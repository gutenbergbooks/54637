<p class="first">Few Cornish people are probably aware how wide-spread
still with us is the belief in charms and charmers, ghosts, and all
other superstitions; nor that there are witches in our county, shunned
and dreaded by some who fear their supposed power to ill-wish those who
offend them, and sought out by others who want by their aid to avert
the evil eye, or by their incantations to remove the spells already
cast on them and their cattle by an ill-wisher who has
&ldquo;overlooked&rdquo; them.</p>
<p>Folk-lore is an almost inexhaustible subject. There must be many
charms in use here that have not come under my notice; a few are too
coarse to record, as are some of the tales.</p>
<p>A book on folk-lore cannot in this century contain original matter;
it must be compiled from various sources. I have when quoting from
other writers given my authority, and to communications from friends
generally appended their names. To &ldquo;One and All&rdquo; I beg
leave to tender my sincere thanks.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="xd25e179"><span class="xd25e179init">C</span>ornwall has
always been a county largely given to hospitality, and, as &ldquo;all
Cornish gentlemen are cousins,&rdquo; they have from time immemorial
made it a practice to meet at each other&rsquo;s houses to celebrate
their feasts and saints&rsquo; days.</p>
<p>Since &ldquo;there are more saints in Cornwall than there are in
heaven,&rdquo; these friendly gatherings must necessarily be very
numerous. Each parish has its own particular saint to which its church
is dedicated. The feasts held in their honour, probably dating from the
foundation of the churches, are kept on the nearest Sunday and Monday
to dedication day, called by the people &ldquo;feasten&rdquo; Sunday
and Monday.</p>
<p>Every family, however poor, tries to have a better dinner than usual
on feasten Sunday; generally a joint of meat with a
&ldquo;figgy-pudden&rdquo; (a baked or boiled suet-pudding with raisins
in it).</p>
<p>On the preceding Saturdays large quantities of &ldquo;plum
cake&rdquo; are baked; light currant cakes raised with barm (yeast),
and coloured bright yellow with saffron (as dear as
&ldquo;saffern&rdquo; is a very common simile in Cornwall). This
&ldquo;saffern cake&rdquo; at tea is often supplemented with
&ldquo;heavy cake&rdquo; (a delicacy peculiar to the county), a rich
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>currant paste, about an inch thick, made with
clotted cream, and eaten hot.</p>
<p>The Western hounds meet in all the villages situated at a convenient
distance from their kennel, at ten o&rsquo;clock on feasten Mondays,
and, after a breakfast given by the squire of the parish to the
huntsmen, start for their run from somewhere near the parish church
(the &ldquo;church town&rdquo;). Three or four houses clustered
together, and even sometimes a single house, is called in Cornwall
&ldquo;a town,&rdquo; a farmyard is &ldquo;a town place,&rdquo; and
London is often spoken of as &ldquo;Lunnon church town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first of the West Penwith feasts is that of Paul, a parish close
to Penzance, which has not the Apostle Paul but <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Pol-de-Lion for its patron saint. It falls on the
nearest Sunday to 10th of October. An old proverb says, &ldquo;Rain for
Paul, rain for all,&rdquo; therefore, should the day be wet, it is of
course looked upon by the young people as a bad sign for their future
merry-makings. An annual bowling-match was formerly held on feasten
Monday, between Paul and Mousehole men (Mousehole is a fishing village
in the same parish); the last of them took place sixty years ago. Up to
that time the bowling-green, an artificially raised piece of ground,
was kept in order by the parishioners. No one in the neighbourhood now
knows the game; the church schools are built on a part of the site, and
the remainder is the village playground. If there were ever any other
peculiar customs celebrated at Paul feast they are quite forgotten, and
the Monday night&rsquo;s carousal at the public-houses has here, as
elsewhere, given place to church and chapel teas, followed by concerts
in the school-rooms, although there are still a few
&ldquo;standings&rdquo; (stalls) in the streets, for the sale of
gingerbread nuts and sweetmeats, and one or two swings and
merry-go-rounds, largely patronised by children.</p>
<p>October 12th. A fair, called Roast Goose Fair, is held at
Redruth.</p>
<p>On the nearest Saturday to Hallowe&rsquo;en, October 31st, the
fruiterers of Penzance display in their windows very large apples,
known locally as &ldquo;Allan&rdquo; apples. These were formerly bought
by the inhabitants and all the country people from the neighbourhood
(for whom Penzance is the market-town), and one was given to each
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>member of the family to be eaten for luck. The elder
girls put theirs, before they ate them, under their pillows, to dream
of their sweethearts. A few of the apples are still sold; but the
custom, which, I have lately been told, was also observed at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, is practically dying out. On
&ldquo;Allantide,&rdquo; at Newlyn West, two strips of wood are joined
crosswise by a nail in the centre; at each of the four ends a lighted
candle is stuck, with apples hung between them. This is fastened to a
beam, or the ceiling of the kitchen, and made to revolve rapidly. The
players, who try to catch the apples in their mouths, often get instead
a taste of the candle.</p>
<p>In Cornwall, as in other parts of England, many charms were tried on
Hallowe&rsquo;en to discover with whom you were to spend your future
life, or if you were to remain unmarried, such as pouring melted lead
through the handle of the front door key. The fantastic shapes it
assumed foretold your husband&rsquo;s profession or trade.</p>
<p>Rolling three names, each written on a separate piece of paper,
tightly in the centre of three balls of earth. These were afterwards
put into a deep basin of water, and anxiously watched until one of them
opened, as the name on the first slip which came to the surface would
be that of the person you were to marry.</p>
<p>Tying the front door key tightly with your left leg garter between
the leaves of a Bible at one particular chapter in the Song of Solomon.
It was then held on the forefinger, and when the sweetheart&rsquo;s
name was mentioned it turned round.</p>
<p>Slipping a wedding-ring on to a piece of cotton, held between the
forefinger and thumb, saying, &ldquo;If my husband&rsquo;s name is to
be &mdash;&mdash; let this ring swing!&rdquo; Of course, when the name
of the person preferred was spoken, the holder unconsciously made the
ring oscillate. I have, when a school-girl, assisted at these rites,
and I expect the young people still practise them.</p>
<p>In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cubert&rsquo;s parish, East
Cornwall, is a celebrated Holy well, so named, the inhabitants say,
from its virtues having been discovered on All Hallows-day. It is
covered at high spring tides.</p>
<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just feast (which, when the mines in
that district were prosperous, was kept up with more revelry than
almost any other) is always held on the nearest Sunday to All
Saints&rsquo;-day. Formerly, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href=
"#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>on the Monday, many games were played,
viz.&mdash;&ldquo;Kook, a trial of casting quoits farthest and nearest
to the goal, now all but forgotten&rdquo; (Bottrell), wrestling, and
kailles, or keels (ninepins), &amp;c. Much beer and
&ldquo;moonshine&rdquo; (spirit that had not paid the duty) were drunk,
and, as the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just men are proverbially
pugnacious, the sports often ended with a free fight. A paragraph in a
local paper for November, 1882, described a <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Just feast in those days as &ldquo;A hobble, a
squabble, and a &lsquo;hubbadullion&rsquo; altogether.&rdquo; Rich and
poor still at this season keep open house, and all the young people
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just who are in service for many
miles around, if they can possibly be spared, go home on the Saturday
and stay until the Tuesday morning. A small fair is held in the streets
on Monday evening, when the young men are expected to treat their
sweethearts liberally, and a great deal of &ldquo;foolish money&rdquo;
that can be ill afforded is often spent.</p>
<p>In many Cornish parishes the bells are rung on November 4th,
&ldquo;Ringing night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The celebration of Gunpowder Plot has quite died out in West
Cornwall, but in Launceston, and in other towns in the eastern part of
the county, it is still observed. As regularly as the 5th of November
comes around, fireworks are let off, and bonfires lit, to lively music
played by the local bands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year, 1884, &lsquo;Young Stratton&rsquo; celebrated the
Fifth with much more than his customary enthusiasm. A good sum was
raised by public subscription by the energy of Mr. C. A. Saunders. The
Bude fife and drum band headed a grotesque procession, formed at
Howl&rsquo;s Bridge, and second in order came a number of equestrian
torch-bearers in all kinds of costumes, furnished by wardrobes of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s navy, the Royal Marines, the Yeomanry, and numerous
other sources. &lsquo;Guido Faux&rsquo; followed in his car, honoured
by a postilion and a band of Christy Minstrels; then came foot
torch-bearers, and a crowd of enthusiastic citizens, who
&lsquo;hurraed&rsquo; to their hearts&rsquo; content. Noticeable were
the banners, &lsquo;Success to Young Stratton,&rsquo; the Cornish arms,
and &lsquo;God save the Queen.&rsquo; The display of fireworks took
place from a field overlooking the town, and the inhabitants grouped
together at points of vantage to witness <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>the display. The bonfire was
lit on Stamford Hill, where the carnival ended. Good order and good
humour prevailed.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Western Morning News.</i>)</p>
<p>When I was a girl, I was taught the following doggerel rhymes, which
were on this day then commonly chanted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Please to remember the fifth of November!</p>
<p class="line">A stick or a stake, for King George&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p class="line">A faggot or rope, to hang the Pope.</p>
<p class="line">For Gunpowder Plot, shall never be forgot,</p>
<p class="line">Whilst Castle Ryan stands upon a rock.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This was in Victoria&rsquo;s reign; where Castle Ryan
stands I have never been able to learn.</p>
<p>The old custom formerly practised in Camborne, of taking a
marrow-bone from the butchers on the Saturday before the feast, which
is held on the nearest Sunday to Martinmas, was, in 1884, revived in
its original form. &ldquo;A number of gentlemen, known as the
&lsquo;Homage Committee,&rsquo; went round the market with hampers,
which were soon filled with marrow-bones, and they afterwards visited
the public-houses as
&lsquo;tasters.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Cornishman.</i>)</p>
<p>One night in November is known in Padstow as &ldquo;Skip-skop
night,&rdquo; when the boys of the place go about with a stone in a
sling; with this they strike the doors, and afterwards slily throw in
winkle-shells, dirt, &amp;c. Mr. T. Q. Couch says: &ldquo;They strike
violently against the doors of the houses and ask for money to make a
feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, on the Saturday before
Advent Sunday, &ldquo;Fair-mo&rdquo; (pig fair) is held. This town is
much celebrated locally for macaroons; a great many are then bought as
&ldquo;fairings.&rdquo; The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives fishing
(pilchard) season generally ends in November, consequently at this time
there is often no lack of money.</p>
<p>The feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maddern, or Madron
feast, which is also that of Penzance (Penzance being until recently in
that parish), is on Advent Sunday.</p>
<p>The last bull-baiting held here was on the &ldquo;feasten&rdquo;
Monday of 1813, and took place in the field on which the Union is now
built. The bull was supplied by a squire from Kimyel, in the
neighbouring parish of Paul. A ship&rsquo;s anchor, which must have
been carried up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>hill from Penzance quay, a distance of nearly three
miles, was firmly fixed in the centre of the field, and to it the bull
was tied. Bull-baiting was soon after discontinued in Cornwall. The
following account of the last I had from a gentleman who was well known
in the county. He said, &ldquo;This I think took place in a field
adjoining Ponsandane bridge, in Gulval parish, at the east of Penzance,
in the summer of 1814. I remember the black bull being led by four men.
The crowd was dispersed early in the evening by a severe thunderstorm,
which much alarmed the people, who thought it (I was led to believe) a
judgment from heaven.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>T.S.B.</abbr>)</p>
<p>The second Thursday before Christmas is in East Cornwall kept by the
&ldquo;tinners&rdquo; (miners) as a holiday in honour of one of the
reputed discoverers of tin. It is known as Picrous-day. Chewidden
Thursday (White Thursday), another &ldquo;tinners&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
holiday, falls always on the last clear Thursday before Christmas-day.
Tradition says it is the anniversary of the day on which &ldquo;white
tin&rdquo; (smelted tin) was first made or sold in Cornwall.</p>
<p>On Christmas-eve, in East as well as West Cornwall, poor women,
sometimes as many as twenty in a party, call on their richer neighbours
asking alms. This is &ldquo;going a gooding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Falmouth the lower classes formerly expected from all the
shopkeepers, of whom they bought any of their Christmas groceries, a
slice of cake and a small glass of gin. Some of the oldest established
tradespeople still observe this custom; but it will soon be a thing of
the past.</p>
<p>In some parts of the county it is customary for each household to
make a batch of currant cakes on Christmas-eve. These cakes are made in
the ordinary manner, coloured with saffron, as is the custom in these
parts. On this occasion the peculiarity of the cakes is, that a small
portion of the dough in the centre of each top is pulled up and made
into a form which resembles a very small cake on the top of a large
one, and this centre-piece is usually called &ldquo;the
Christmas.&rdquo; Each person in a house has his or her especial cake,
and every person ought to taste a small piece of every other
person&rsquo;s cake. Similar cakes are also bestowed on the hangers-on
of the establishment, such as laundresses, sempstresses, charwomen,
&amp;c.; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>and even some people who are in the receipt of
weekly charity call, as a matter of course, for their Christmas cakes.
The cakes must not be cut until Christmas-day, it being probably
&ldquo;unlucky to eat them sooner.&rdquo;&mdash;(Geo. C. Boase,
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 5th series, Dec. 21st, 1878.)</p>
<p>The materials to make these and nearly all the cakes at this season
were at one time given by the grocers to their principal customers.</p>
<p>In Cornwall, as in other English counties, houses are at Christmas
&ldquo;dressed up&rdquo; with evergreens, sold in small bunches, called
&ldquo;Penn&rsquo;orths of Chris&rsquo;mas&rdquo;; and two hoops
fastened one in the other by nails at the centres are gaily decorated
with evergreens, apples, oranges, &amp;c., and suspended from the
middle beam in the ceiling of the best kitchen. This is the
&ldquo;bush,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kissing bush.&rdquo; At night a lighted
candle is put in it, stuck on the bottom nail; but once or twice lately
I have seen a Chinese lantern hanging from the top one.</p>
<p>In a few remote districts on Christmas-eve children may be, after
nightfall, occasionally (but rarely) found dancing around painted
lighted candles placed in a box of sand. This custom was very general
fifty years ago. The church towers, too, are sometimes illuminated.
This of course, on the coast can only be done in very calm weather. The
tower of Zennor church (Zennor is a village on the north coast of
Cornwall, between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Just) was lit up in 1883, for the first time since
1866.</p>
<p>When open chimneys were universal in farmhouses the Christmas stock,
mock, or block (the log), on which a rude figure of a man had been
chalked, was kindled with great ceremony; in some parts with a piece of
charred wood that had been saved from the last year&rsquo;s
&ldquo;block.&rdquo; A log in Cornwall is almost always called a
&ldquo;block.&rdquo; &ldquo;Throw a block on the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Candles painted by some member of the family were often lighted at
the same time.</p>
<p>The choir from the parish church and dissenting chapels go from
house to house singing &ldquo;curls&rdquo; (carols), for which they are
given money or feasted; but the quaint old carols, &ldquo;The first
good joy that Mary had,&rdquo; &ldquo;I saw three ships come sailing
in,&rdquo; common forty years ago, are now never heard. The natives of
Cornwall have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>always famous for their carols; some of their tunes
are very old. Even the Knockers, Sprig-gans, and all the underground
spirits that may be always heard working where there is tin (and who
are said to be the ghosts of the Jews who crucified Jesus), in olden
times held mass and sang carols on Christmas-eve.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this century at the ruined baptistery of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan, in West Cornwall (Par-chapel
Well), all the carol-singers in that district, after visiting the
neighbouring villages, met and sang together many carols. Mr. Bottrell
says, &ldquo;One was never forgotten, in which according to our West
Country version, Holy Mary says to her dear Child:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Go the wayst out, Child Jesus,</p>
<p class="line">Go the wayst out to play;</p>
<p class="line">Down by God&rsquo;s Holy Well</p>
<p class="line">I see three pretty children,</p>
<p class="line">As ever tongue can tell.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This for its sweet simplicity is still a
favourite in the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old carol or ballad,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Come and I will sing you,&rdquo; etc.,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">known to many old people in all parts of the county,
has been thought by some to be peculiar to Cornwall; but this is an
error, as it has been heard elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the plentiful supper always provided on this night,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e349src" href="#xd25e349" name="xd25e349src">1</a>
egg-hot, or eggy-hot, was the principal drink. It was made with eggs,
hot beer, sugar, and rum, and was poured from one jug into another
until it became quite white and covered with froth. A sweet giblet pie
was one of the standing dishes at a Christmas dinner&mdash;a kind of
mince-pie, into which the giblets of a goose, boiled and finely
chopped, were put instead of beef. Cornwall is noted for its pies, that
are eaten on all occasions; some of them are curious mixtures, such as
squab-pie, which is made with layers of well-seasoned fat mutton and
apples, with onions and raisins. Mackerel pie: the ingredients of this
are mackerel and parsley stewed in milk, then covered with a paste and
baked. When brought to table a hole is cut in the paste, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>and a basin
of clotted cream thrown in it. Muggetty pie, made from sheep&rsquo;s
entrails (muggets), parsley, and cream. &ldquo;The devil is afraid to
come into Cornwall for fear of being baked in a pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a curious Christmas superstition connected with the Fogo,
Vug, or Vow (local names for a cove) at Pendeen, in North <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Just.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn on Christmas-day the spirit of the &lsquo;Vow&rsquo;
has frequently been seen just within the entrance near the cove, in the
form of a beautiful lady dressed in white, with a red rose in her
mouth. There were persons living a few years since who had seen the
fair but not less fearful vision; for disaster was sure to visit those
who intruded on the spirit&rsquo;s morning
airing.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bottrell, <i>Traditions, &amp;c., West
Cornwall</i>, 2nd series.)</p>
<p>The following is an account by an anonymous writer of a Christmas
custom in East Cornwall:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some places the parishioners walk in procession, visiting
the principal orchards in the parish. In each orchard one tree is
selected, as the representative of the rest; this is saluted with a
certain form of words, which have in them the form of an incantation.
They then sprinkle the tree with cider, or dash a bowl of cider against
it, to ensure its bearing plentifully the ensuing year. In other places
the farmers and their servants only assemble on the occasion, and after
immersing apples in cider hang them on the apple-trees. They then
sprinkle the trees with cider; and after uttering a formal incantation,
they dance round it (or rather round them), and return to the farmhouse
to conclude these solemn rites with copious draughts of cider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Warleggan, on Christmas-eve, it was customary for some of
the household to put in the fire (bank it up), and the rest to take a
jar of cider, a bottle, and a gun to the orchard, and put a small bough
into the bottle. Then they said:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to thee, old apple-tree!</p>
<p class="line">Hats full, packs full, great bushel-bags full!</p>
<p class="line">Hurrah! and fire off the gun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&mdash;(Old Farmer, Mid Cornwall, through T. Q. Couch,
Sept. 1883, <i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W.
Antiquary</abbr></i>.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>The words chanted in East Cornwall were:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Health to thee, good apple-tree,</p>
<p class="line">Pocket-fulls, hat-fulls, peck-fulls, bushel-bag
fulls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">An old proverb about these trees runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Blossom in March, for fruit you may search,</p>
<p class="line">Blossom in April, eat you will,</p>
<p class="line">Blossom in May, eat night and day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At one time small sugared cakes were laid on
the branches. This curious custom has been supposed to be a
propitiation of some spirit.&rdquo;&mdash;(Mrs. Damant, Cowes, through
Folk-Lore Society.)</p>
<p>From Christmas to Twelfth-tide parties of mummers known as
&lsquo;Goose or Geese-dancers&rsquo; paraded the streets in all sorts
of disguises, with masks on. They often behaved in such an unruly
manner that women and children were afraid to venture out. If the doors
of the houses were not locked they would enter uninvited and stay,
playing all kinds of antics, until money was given them to go away.
&ldquo;A well-known character amongst them, about fifty years ago
(1862), was the hobby-horse, represented by a man carrying a piece of
wood in the form of a horse&rsquo;s head and neck, with some
contrivance for opening and shutting the mouth with a loud snapping
noise, the performer being so covered with a horse-cloth or hide of a
horse as to resemble the animal, whose curvetings, biting and other
motions he imitated. Some of these &lsquo;guise-dancers&rsquo;
occasionally masked themselves with the skins of the head of bullocks

<p>Sometimes they were more ambitious and acted a version of the old
play, &ldquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George and the
Dragon,&rdquo; which differed but little from that current in other
countries.</p>
<p>Bottrell, in his <i>Traditions in W. Cornwall</i> (2nd series),
gives large extracts from another Christmas-play, &ldquo;Duffy and the
Devil.&rdquo; It turns upon the legend, common in all countries, of a
woman who had sold herself to a devil, who was to do her knitting or
spinning for her. He was to claim his bargain at the end of three years
if she could not find out his name before the time expired. Of course,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>she gets it by stratagem; her husband, who knows
nothing of the compact, first meets the devil, whilst out hunting, the
day before the time is up, and makes him half-drunk. An old woman in
Duffy&rsquo;s pay (Witch Bet) completes the work, and in that state the
devil sings the following words, ending with his name, which Bet
remembers and tells her mistress:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knit and spun for her</p>
<p class="line">Three years to the day;</p>
<p class="line">To-morrow she shall ride with me</p>

<p class="line">Far away! far away!</p>

<p class="line">That my name is

<p class="first">These &ldquo;goose-dancers&rdquo; became such a terror
to the respectable inhabitants of Penzance that the Corporation put
them down about ten years since, and every Christmas-eve a notice is
posted in conspicuous places forbidding their appearance in the
streets, but they still perambulate the streets of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. Guise-dancing wit must have very much
deteriorated since the beginning of the present century, as writers
before that time speak of the mirth it afforded; and the saying,
&ldquo;as good as a Christmas-play,&rdquo; is commonly used to describe
a very witty or funny thing.</p>
<p>It was the custom in Scilly eighty years ago for girls to go to
church on Christmas morning dressed all in white, verifying the old
proverb&mdash;&ldquo;pride is never a-cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Porthminster Beach on Christmas-day, as seen from the
Malakoff, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, at nine o&rsquo;clock in
the morning the boys began to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>assemble on the beach with their bats
and balls. As soon as twelve youths arrived a game commenced, called
&lsquo;Rounders.&rsquo; The first thing to be done was to right up the
&lsquo;bickens.&rsquo; This accomplished, the sides were chosen in the
following manner:&mdash;Two of the best players, whom we will call
Matthew and Phillip, went aside and selected two objects&mdash;the new
and old pier. The old pier was Matthew and the new pier was Phillip.
After this was arranged the &lsquo;mopper&rsquo; selected the old pier,
which meant he would rather have Matthew his side than Phillip. Then
Phillip selected some one for his side; and so it went on until the
whole twelve were elected one side or the other. Then they tossed up
for the first innings. Phillip&rsquo;s side won the toss, and it was
their luck to go in first. While they are taking off their jackets and
getting ready to go in I will briefly describe the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bickens, four in number, were piles of sand thrown up;
each one being about ten yards from one another, and arranged so as to
form a square. In the centre of the square the bowler was placed with
ball in hand. Behind the batsman stands the &lsquo;tip,&rsquo; while
the other four were off a long way waiting for the long hits. The coats
off, in went the first batsman. The ball was thrown towards him and he
tipped it. The tip instantly took the ball and threw it at the batsman,
and hit him before he arrived at the first bicken, and he was
consequently out. The second batsman had better luck; for on the ball
being thrown to him he sent it out to sea, and by that means he ran a
rounder, or in other words he ran around the four bickens without being
hit by the ball. The next batsman went in. The ball was thrown to him,
when, lo! it went whizzing into the bowler&rsquo;s hands and was
caught. This unlucky hit and lucky catch got the whole side out, before
three of them had a chance to show their skill. The other side then
went in, laughing at the discomfiture of their opponents. The tables,
however, were very soon turned; for the very first hit was caught, and
this produced a row, and the game was broken up!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then went to the next lot: They were playing
&lsquo;catchers.&rsquo; There is only one bicken required in this game,
and at this stood a lad called Watty, with bat and ball in hand. At
last he hit the ball, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>up it went flying in the air,
descended, and passed through the hands of a boy named Peters. Peters
took the ball from the sand and asked Watty, &lsquo;How many?&rsquo;
Watty replied&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Two a good scat,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e481src" href="#xd25e481" name="xd25e481src">2</a></p>
<p class="line">Try for the bat.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Peters threw the ball to the bicken, but it
stopped about three lengths short. Watty took the ball up and again
sent it a great way. The question was again asked, and Watty gave the
same answer. Again the ball was thrown to the bicken, but this time
with better success; for it stopped at the distance of the length of
the bat and so was within the distance named. Williams then went in. He
was a strong lusty fellow, and the ball was sent spinning along the
sand. It was picked up by Curnow, who asked, &lsquo;How
many?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Three a good scat,</p>
<p class="line">Try for the bat.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The ball was thrown home and rolled about three
bats from the bicken. This point, however, was the breaking-up of the
game, for Williams said it was more than three bats off, whilst Curnow
maintained that it was not three bats off, and there being no chance of
a compromise being arrived at the game was broken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next party was one of young men. They were playing
rounders with a wooden ball, instead of an india-rubber one, as is
generally used. They were twelve each side, and the bickens were about
20 yards distant. By this time the tide was out a great way, so that
there was no fear of the ball being knocked to sea, as was the case
with the other boys. When I got there they had been playing for about
an hour, and the side that was in had been in about half of that time.
The first hit I saw was &lsquo;a beauty!&rsquo; The ball was sent about
75 yards, and the result was a rounder. Two or three other persons went
in and did the same thing, and so the game went on for about an hour
longer, when one of the fellows knocked up a catcher and was caught.
This side had stayed in for about one hour and a half. The other side
went in at about a quarter to three, and after playing about another
hour they went home to tea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to tea also, but was soon up in the Malakoff again. It
was so dark that the play was stopped for the time. At about seven
o&rsquo;clock the older part of the town began to congregate, and about
a quarter-past seven they began to play &lsquo;Thursa.&rsquo; This game
is too well known to need description, and I need only say that it was
played about one hour, when they began to form a ring with the
intention, I supposed, of playing that best of all games,

<p>On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen&rsquo;s-day, 26th
December, before the days of gun-licences, every man or boy who could
by any means get a gun went out shooting, and it was dangerous to walk
the lanes. The custom is said to have had its origin in the legend of
one of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen&rsquo;s guards being
awakened by a bird just as his prisoner was going to escape. A similar
practice prevailed in the neighbourhood of Penzance on &ldquo;feasten
Monday,&rdquo; the day after Advent Sunday; but on that day I have
never heard of any religious idea connected with it.</p>
<p>In the week after Christmas-day a fair is held at Launceston (and
also at Okehampton in Devonshire), called &ldquo;giglet fair&rdquo; (a
&ldquo;giglet or giglot&rdquo; is a giddy young woman). It is
principally attended by young people. &ldquo;At this &lsquo;giglet
market,&rsquo; or wife-market, the rustic swain was privileged with
self-introduction to any of the nymphs around him, so that he had a
good opportunity of choosing a suitable partner if tired of a single
life.&rdquo;&mdash;(Britton and Brayley&rsquo;s <i>Devon and
Cornwall</i>.)</p>
<p>It is unlucky to begin a voyage on Childermas
(Innocents&rsquo;-day), also to wash clothes, or to do any but
necessary household work.</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s-eve in the villages of East Cornwall, soon after
dusk, parties of men, from four to six in a party, carrying a small
bowl in their hands, went from house to house begging money to make a
feast. They opened the doors without knocking, called out Warsail, and
sang,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;These poor jolly Warsail boys</p>
<p class="line">Come travelling through the mire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This custom was common fifty years since, and may
still be observed in remote rural districts. There is one saint whose
name is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>familiar to all in Cornwall, but whose sex is
unknown. This saint has much to answer for; promises made, but never
intended to be kept, are all to be fulfilled on next <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Tibbs&rsquo;s-eve, a day that some folks say
&ldquo;falls between the old and new year;&rdquo; others describe it as
one that comes &ldquo;neither before nor after Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parties are general in Cornwall on New Year&rsquo;s-eve to watch in
the New Year and wish friends health and happiness; but I know of no
peculiar customs, except that before retiring to rest the old women
opened their Bibles at hap-hazard to find out their luck for the coming
year. The text on which the fore-finger of the right hand rested was
supposed to foretell the future. And money, generally a piece of
silver, was placed on the threshold, to be brought in the first thing
on the following day, that there might be no lack of it for the year.
Nothing was ever lent on New Year&rsquo;s-day, as little as possible
taken out, but all that could be brought into the house. &ldquo;I have
even known the dust of the floor swept inwards.&rdquo;&mdash;(T. Q.
Couch, <i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>,
September, 1883.)</p>
<p>Door-steps on New Year&rsquo;s-day were formerly sanded for good
luck, because I suppose people coming into the house were sure to bring
some of it in with them sticking to their feet.</p>
<p>Many elderly people at the beginning of the present century still
kept to the &ldquo;old style,&rdquo; and held their Christmas-day on
Epiphany. On the eve of that day they said &ldquo;the cattle in the
fields and stalls never lay down, but at midnight turned their faces to
the east and fell on their knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twelfth-day (old Christmas-day) was a time of general feasting and
merriment. Into the Twelfth-day cake were put a wedding-ring, a
sixpence, and a thimble. It was cut into as many portions as there were
guests; the person who found the wedding-ring in his (or her) portion
would be married before the year was out; the holder of the thimble
would never be married, and the one who got the sixpence would die
rich. After candlelight many games were played around the open fires. I
will describe one:&mdash;&ldquo;Robin&rsquo;s alight.&rdquo; A piece of
stick was set on fire, and whirled rapidly in the hands of the first
player, who repeated the words&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Robin&rsquo;s alight, and if he go out
I&rsquo;ll saddle your back.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was then passed on, and the person who let the spark die had to
pay a forfeit.&mdash;(West Cornwall.)</p>
<p>This game in East Cornwall was known as &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s alive and likely to live,</p>
<p class="line">If he die in my hand a pawn I&rsquo;ll give.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In this county forfeits are always called
&ldquo;pawns&rdquo;; they are cried by the holder of them,
saying,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pawn and a very pretty pawn!</p>
<p class="line">And what shall the owner of this pawn do?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After the midnight supper, at which in one village in
the extreme West a pie of four-and-twenty blackbirds always appeared,
many spells to forecast the future were practised. The following
account of them was given to me by a friend. He says&mdash;&ldquo;I
engaged in them once at Sennen (the village at the Land&rsquo;s End)
with a lot of girls, but as my object was only to spoil sport and make
the girls laugh or speak, it was not quite satisfactory. I suppose the
time to which I refer is over forty years ago. After making up a large
turf fire, for hot &lsquo;umers&rsquo; (embers) and pure water are
absolutely necessary in these divinations, the young people silently
left the house in single file, to pull the rushes and gather the
ivy-leaves by means of which they were to learn whether they were to be
married, and to whom; and if any, or how many, of their friends were to
die before the end of the year. On leaving and on returning each of
these Twelfth-night diviners touched the &lsquo;cravel&rsquo; with the
forehead and &lsquo;wished.&rsquo; The cravel is the tree that preceded
lintels in chimney corners, and its name from this custom may have been
derived from the verb &lsquo;to crave.&rsquo; Had either of the party
inadvertently broken the silence before the rushes and ivy-leaves had
been procured they would all have been obliged to retrace their steps
to the house and again touch the cravel; but this time all went well.
When we came back those who wished to know their fate named the rushes
in pairs, and placed them in the hot embers: one or two of the engaged
couples being too shy to do this for themselves, their friends, amidst
much laughing, did it for them. The manner in which the rushes burned
showed if the young people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>were to be married to the person
chosen or not: some, of course, burnt well, others parted, and one or
two went out altogether. The couples that burnt smoothly were to be
wedded, and the one named after the rush that lasted longest outlived
the other. This settled, one ivy-leaf was thrown on the fire; the
number of cracks it made was the number of years before the wedding
would take place. Then two were placed on the hot ashes; the cracks
they gave this time showed how many children the two would have. We
then drew ivy-leaves named after present or absent friends through a
wedding ring, and put them into a basin of water which we left until
the next morning. Those persons whose leaves had shrivelled or turned
black in the night were to die before the next Twelfth-tide, and those
who were so unfortunate as to find their leaves spotted with red, by
some violent death, unless a &lsquo;pellar&rsquo; (wise man) could by
his skill and incantations grant protection. These prophecies through
superstition sometimes unluckily fulfilled themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the twelve days of Christmas card-playing was a very
favourite amusement with all classes. Whilst the old people enjoyed
their game of whist with &lsquo;swabbers,&rsquo; the young ones had
their round games. I will append the rules of two or three for those
who would like to try them.</p>
<p>Whist (or whisk, as I have heard an old lady call it and maintain
that that was its proper name) with &ldquo;swabbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This game, which was played as recently as 1880, nightly, by four
maiden ladies at Falmouth, is like ordinary whist; but each player
before beginning to play puts into the pool a fixed sum for
&ldquo;swabs.&rdquo; The &ldquo;swab-cards&rdquo; are&mdash;ace and
deuce of trumps, ace of hearts and knave of clubs. The four cards are
of equal value; but should hearts be trumps the ace would count
double.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Board-&rsquo;em,&rdquo; a round game that can be played by
any number of players, from two to eight; it is played for fish, and
there must never be less than six fish in the pool. Six cards are dealt
to each person; and the thirteenth, if two are playing, the nineteenth
if three, and so on, is turned up for trumps. The fore-hand plays; the
next player, if he has one, must follow suit, if not, he may play
another suit, or trump. The highest card of the original suit, if not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>trumped, takes the trick and one or more fish,
according to the number staked. If you have neither card in your hand
that you think will make a trick you may decline to play, in which case
you only lose your stake; but should you play and fail to take a trick
you pay for the whole company, and are said to &ldquo;be
boarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ranter-go-round&rdquo; was formerly played in four divisions
marked with chalk upon a tea-tray; or even, in some cases, on a
bellows&mdash;it is now played on a table, and is called &ldquo;Miss
Joan.&rdquo; Any number of players may join in it. The first player
throws down any card of any suit, and says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd25e586">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a &mdash;&mdash; as you
may see.</p>
<p class="line"><i>2nd Player</i>&mdash;Here&rsquo;s another as good as
he.</p>
<p class="line"><i>3rd Player</i>&mdash;And here&rsquo;s the best of
all the three.</p>
<p class="line"><i>4th Player</i>&mdash;And here&rsquo;s Miss Joan,
come tickle me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The holder of the fourth card wins the trick. He
sometimes added the words wee-wee; but these are now generally omitted.
If the person sitting next to the fore-hand has neither one of the
cards demanded (one of the same value as the first played, in another
suit), he pays one to the pool, as must all in turn who fail to produce
the right cards. The player of the third may have the fourth in his
hand, in which case all the others pay. The holder of the most tricks
wins the game and takes the pool.</p>
<p>I once, about thirty years since, at this season of the year, joined
some children at Camborne who were playing a very primitive game called
by them &ldquo;pinny-ninny.&rdquo; A basin turned upside down was
placed in the centre of a not very large round table. The players were
supplied with small piles of pins&mdash;not the well-made ones sold in
papers, but clumsy things with wire
heads&mdash;&ldquo;pound-pins.&rdquo; A large bottle full of them
might, then, always be seen in the general shop window of every little
country village. Each in turn dropped a pin over the side of the basin,
and he whose pin fell and formed a cross on the top of the heap was
entitled to add them to his own pile. This went on until one player had
beggared all the others. Poor children before Christmas often begged
pins to play this game, and their request was always granted by the
gift of two. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>A wishing-well, near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, was
sometimes called Pennameny Well, from the custom of dropping pins into
it. Pedna-a-mean is the old Cornish for
&ldquo;heads-and-tails.&rdquo;&mdash;(See <i>Divination at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Roche and Madron Well</i>.)</p>
<p>All Christmas-cakes must be eaten by the night of Twelfth-tide, as
it is unlucky to have any left, and all decorations must be taken down
on the next day, because for every forgotten leaf of evergreen a ghost
will be seen in the house in the course of the ensuing year. This
latter superstition does not prevail, however, in all parts of
Cornwall, as in some districts a small branch is kept to scare away
evil spirits.</p>
<p>January 24th, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul&rsquo;s-eve, is a
holiday with the miners, and is called by them &lsquo;Paul
pitcher-day,&rsquo; from a custom they have of setting up a
water-pitcher, which they pelt with stones until it is broken in
pieces. A new one is afterwards bought and carried to a beer-shop to be
filled with beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a curious custom prevalent in some parts of Cornwall
of throwing broken pitchers and other earthen vessels against the doors
of dwelling-houses on the eve of the conversion of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, thence locally called &lsquo;Paul
pitcher-night.&rsquo; On that evening parties of young people
perambulate the parishes in which the custom is retained, exclaiming as
they throw the sherds, &lsquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul&rsquo;s-eve and here&rsquo;s a heave.&rsquo; According to the
received notions the first heave cannot be objected to; but, upon its
being repeated, the inhabitants of the house whose door is thus
attacked may, if they can, seize the offenders and inflict summary
justice upon them.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>F.M.</abbr>, <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, March, 1874.)</p>
<p>I have heard of this practice from a native of East Cornwall, who
told me the pitchers were filled with broken sherds, filth, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The weather on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul&rsquo;s-day
still, with the old people, foretells the weather for the ensuing year,
and the rhyme common to all England is repeated by them:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul&rsquo;s-day be fine and clear,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey, a village in
East Cornwall, is so named in honour of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Blaize, who is said to have landed at Par, a small neighbouring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>seaport, when he came on a visit to England. His
feast, which is held on 3rd February, would not be worth mentioning
were it not for the fact that&mdash;&ldquo;This saint is invoked in the
county for toothache, while applying to the tooth the candle that
burned on the altar of the church dedicated to him. The same candles
are good for sore-throats and curing diseases in
cattle.&rdquo;&mdash;(Mrs. Damant, Cowes.)</p>
<p>On the Monday after <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives feast, which
falls on Quinquagesima Sunday, an annual hurling-match is held on the
sands. Most writers on Cornwall have described the old game. The
following account is taken from <i>The Land&rsquo;s End District</i>,
1862, by R. Edmonds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ball about the size of a cricket-ball, formed of cork, or
light wood, and covered with silver, was hurled into the air, midway
between the goals. Both parties immediately rushed towards it, each
striving to seize and carry it to its own goal. In this contest, when
any individual having possession of the ball found himself overpowered
or outrun by his opponents, he hurled it to one of his own side, if
near enough, or, if not, into some pool, ditch, furze, brake, garden,
house, or other place of concealment, to prevent his adversaries
getting hold of it before his own company could arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hurlers, quaintly says Carew (<i>Survey of Cornwall</i>, p. 74),
&ldquo;<span lang="en">Take their next way ouer hills, dales, hedges,
ditches&mdash;yea, and thorou bushes, briers, mires, plashes, and
rivers whatsoever&mdash;so as you shall sometimes see twenty or thirty
lie tugging together in the water, scrambling and scratching for the
ball. A play verily both rude and rough.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurling between two or more parishes, and between one parish and
another, has long ceased in Cornwall: but hurling by one part of a
parish against another is still played at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, as well as other places in Cornwall. At
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives all the Toms, Wills, and Johns are
on one side, while those having other Christian names range themselves
on the opposite. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb (East
Cornwall) the townspeople contend with the countrymen; at Truro, the
married men with the unmarried; at Helston, two streets with all the
other streets; on the 2nd of May, when their town-bounds are
renewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair-play is good play,&rdquo; is the hurlers&rsquo; motto.
This is sometimes engraven on their balls in the old Cornish language.
Private <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>families possess some of these balls won by their
ancestors early in the last century that are religiously handed down as
heirlooms.</p>
<p>A Druidic circle at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer, in East
Cornwall, is known as the Hurlers, from a tradition that a party of men
hurling on a Sunday were there for their wickedness turned into
stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peasen or Paisen Monday&rsquo; is the Monday before Shrove
Tuesday; it is so called in East Cornwall from a custom of eating
pea-soup there on this day. This practice was once so universal in some
parishes that an old farmer of Lower <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Columb, who had a special aversion to pea-soup, left his home in the
morning, telling his wife that he should not come back to dinner, but
spend the day with a friend. He returned two or three hours after in
great disgust, as at every house in the village he had been asked to
stay and taste their delicious pea-soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day also in East Cornwall bears the name of &lsquo;Hall
Monday,&rsquo; why, I know not. And at dusk on the evening of the same
day it is the custom for boys, and in some cases for those above the
age of boys, to prowl about the streets with short clubs, and to knock
loudly at every door, running off to escape detection on the slightest
sign of a motion within. If, however, no attention be excited, and
especially if any article be discovered, negligently exposed or
carelessly guarded, then the things are carried away, and on the
following morning are seen displayed in some conspicuous place, to
disclose the disgraceful want of vigilance supposed to characterise the
owner. The time when this is practised is called &lsquo;Nicky
Nan&rsquo; night, and the individuals concerned are supposed to
represent some imps of darkness, that seize on and expose unguarded
moments.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Polperro</i>, p. 151, by T. Q. Couch.)</p>
<p>A custom nearly similar to this was practised in Scilly in the last
century.</p>
<p>The dinner on Shrove Tuesday in many Cornish houses consists of
fried eggs and bacon, or salt pork, followed by the universal pancake,
which is eaten by all classes. It is made the full size of the pan, and
currants are put into the batter.</p>
<p>In Penzance large quantities of limpets and periwinkles are gathered
in the afternoon by poor people, to be cooked for their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>supper.
This they call &ldquo;going a-trigging.&rdquo; Any kind of shell-fish
picked up at low water in this district is known as
&ldquo;trig-meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other customs were formerly observed in Penzance on Shrove
Tuesday, peculiar, I believe, to this town.</p>
<p>Women and boys stood at the corners of the streets, with
well-greased, sooty hands, which they rubbed over people&rsquo;s faces.
I remember, not more than thirty years ago, seeing a little boy run
into a house in a great hurry, and ask for what was he wanted. He had
met a woman who had put her hands affectionately on each side of his
face, and said, &ldquo;Your father has been looking for you, my
dear.&rdquo; She had left the marks of her dirty fingers.</p>
<p>The butchers&rsquo; market was always thoroughly cleaned in the
afternoon, to see if the town hose were in perfect repair, and great
merriment was often excited by the firemen turning the full force of
the water on some unwary passer-by.</p>
<p>People, too, were occasionally deluged by having buckets of water
thrown over them. Every Shrove Tuesday after dusk men and boys went
about and threw handfuls of shells, bottles of filth, etc., in at the
doors. It was usual then for drapers to keep their shops open until a
very late hour; and I have been told that boys were occasionally bribed
by the assistants to throw something particularly disagreeable in on
the floors, that the masters might be frightened, and order the shops
to be shut. Still later in the evening signs were taken down, knockers
wrenched off, gates unhung and carried to some distance. This last was
done even as far down as 1881. Pulling boats up and putting them in a
mill-pool (now built over) was a common practice at Mousehole in the
beginning of the century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Landewednack, on Shrove Tuesday, children from the ages of
six to twelve perambulate the parish begging for
&lsquo;Col-perra&rsquo; (probably an old Cornish word); but, whatever
be its meaning, they expect to receive eatables or half-pence. As few
refuse to give, they collect during the day a tolerable booty, in the
shape of money, eggs, buns, apples, etc. The custom has existed from
time immemorial, but none of the inhabitants are acquainted with its
origin.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>A Week in the Lizard</i>, by <abbr title=

<p>I have been favoured by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S.
Rundle, Godolphin, with the formula repeated by the children on this
occasion (now almost forgotten): &ldquo;Hen-cock, han-cock, give me a
&lsquo;tabban&rsquo; (morsel), or else &lsquo;Col-perra&rsquo; shall
come to your door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boys at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, Scilly, and other
places, went about with stones tied to strings, with which they struck
the doors, saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Give me a pancake, now! now! now!</p>
<p class="line">Or I&rsquo;ll knock in your door with a row, tow,
tow!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This custom has only lately (if it has yet) quite died
out. The rhyme at Polperro ran thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Nicky, Nicky, Nan,</p>
<p class="line">Give me some pancake, and then I&rsquo;ll be gone,</p>
<p class="line">But if you give me none</p>

<p>Cock-fighting at Shrovetide was once a very favourite amusement in
Cornwall, and in some of the most remote western villages has until
recently been continued. &ldquo;The Cock-pit&rdquo; at Penzance, a
small part of which still remains as a yard at the Union Hotel,
belonged to and was kept up by the Corporation until (I think) the
beginning of the present century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Rose Price, when young, was a great patron of the pit
between the years 1780&ndash;1790. His father disapproved, and in
consideration of his son giving up cock-fighting bought him a pack of
hounds, the first foxhounds west of
Truro.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>T.S.B.</abbr>)</p>
<p>&ldquo;At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb, about sixty years
ago, on Shrove Tuesday, each child in a dame&rsquo;s school was
expected by the mistress to bring an egg, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock
the children had an egg-battle. Two children stood facing each other,
each held an egg, and struck the end of it against that of the opponent
lengthwise, the result being that one or both were broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unbroken egg was used again and again to fight the rest,
and so the battle raged until all, or all but one, of the eggs were
broken. The child who at the end of the fight held a sound egg was
considered to be the conqueror, and was glorified accordingly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>To save the contents of the eggs, which were the
perquisite of the mistress, she held a plate beneath; and at the end of
the battle the children were dismissed. And the old lady having picked
out all the broken shells, proceeded to prepare her pancakes, of which
she made her dinner.&rdquo;&mdash;(Fred. W. P. Jago, <abbr title=
"Bachelor of Medicine">M.B.</abbr>, Plymouth, <i><abbr title=
"Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, March, 1884.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be now about thirty years ago that I was a
day-scholar at the National School of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Columb, and it was the custom then for each boy and girl to bring an
egg. One of the senior boys stood at a table and wrote the name of the
donor upon each. At about eleven o&rsquo;clock the schoolmaster would
produce a large punchbowl, and as he took up each egg he read the name,
and broke the egg into the bowl. Eggs at that time were sold at three
for a penny.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>W. B.</abbr>, Bodmin, <i><abbr title=
"Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, March, 1884.)</p>
<p>In the eastern part of the county at the beginning of Lent a straw
figure dressed in cast-off clothes, and called
&ldquo;Jack-o&rsquo;-lent,&rdquo; was not long since paraded through
the streets and afterwards hung. Something of this kind is common on
the Continent.</p>
<p>The figure is supposed to represent Judas Iscariot. A slovenly
ragged person is sometimes described as a
&ldquo;Jack-o&rsquo;-lent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1st March.&mdash;In Mid-Cornwall, people arise before the sun is up,
and sweep before the door to sweep away fleas.&mdash;(T. Q. Couch,
<i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, September,
1883.)</p>
<p>5th March.&mdash;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran&rsquo;s day is
a miners&rsquo; holiday. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran is the
patron saint of &ldquo;tinners,&rdquo; and is popularly supposed to
have died drunk. &ldquo;As drunk as a Piraner&rdquo; is a Cornish
proverb.<a id="xd25e827" name="xd25e827"></a></p>
<p>The first Friday in March is another miners&rsquo; holiday,
&ldquo;Friday in Lide.&rdquo; It is marked by a serio-comic custom of
sending a young man on the highest &ldquo;bound,&rdquo; or hillock, of
the &ldquo;works,&rdquo; and allowing him to sleep there as long as he
can, the length of his siesta being the measure of the afternoon nap of
the &ldquo;tinners&rdquo; throughout the ensuing twelve
months.&mdash;(T. Q. Couch.) Lide is an obsolete term for the month of
March still preserved in old proverbs, such as &ldquo;Ducks won&rsquo;t
lay &lsquo;till they&rsquo;ve drunk Lide water.<a id="xd25e831" name=

<p>Of a custom observed at Little Colan, in East Cornwall, on Palm
Sunday, Carew says: &ldquo;<span lang="en">Little Colan is not worth
observation, unlesse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>you will deride or pity their simplicity, who
sought at our Lady Nant&rsquo;s well there to foreknowe what fortune
should betide them, which was in this manner. Upon Palm Sunday these
idle-headed seekers resorted thither with a Palme cross in one hand and
an offring in the other. The offring fell to the Priest&rsquo;s share,
the crosse they threwe into the well; which if it swamme the party
should outliue the yeere; if it sunk a short ensuing death was boded;
and perhaps not altogether vntimely, while a foolish conceite of this
&lsquo;halsening&rsquo; myght the sooner helpe it
onwards.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holy Thursday.&mdash;On that Thursday, and the two following
Thursdays, girls in the neighbourhood of Roche, in East Cornwall,
repair to his holy or wishing well before sunrise. They throw in
crooked pins or pebbles, and, by the bubbles that rise to the surface,
seek to ascertain whether their sweethearts will be true or false.
There was once a chapel near this well, which was then held in great
repute for the cure of all kinds of diseases, and a granite figure of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche stood on the arch of the building
that still covers it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goody Friday&rdquo; (Good Friday) was formerly kept more as a
feast than a fast in Cornwall. Every vehicle was engaged days
beforehand to take parties to some favourite place of resort in the
neighbourhood, and labourers in inland parishes walked to the nearest
seaport to gather &ldquo;wrinkles&rdquo; (winkles), &amp;c.</p>
<p>On the morning of Good Friday at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Constantine, in West Cornwall, an old custom is still observed of going
to Helford river to gather shell-fish (limpets, cockles, &amp;c.); this
river was once famous for oysters, and many were then bought and eaten
on this day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near Padstow, in East Cornwall, is the tower of an old church
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine. In its
vicinity the feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine used
to be annually celebrated, and has only been discontinued of late
years. Its celebration consisted in the destruction of limpet-pies, and
service in the church, followed by a hurling
match.&rdquo;&mdash;(Murray&rsquo;s <i>Cornwall</i>.) Another writer
says: &ldquo;The festival of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Constantine&rdquo; (March 9th) &ldquo;was until very lately kept at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Merran&rdquo; (Constantine and Merran
are now one parish) &ldquo;by an annual hurling match, on which
occasion the owner of Harlyn&rdquo; (a house in the neighbourhood)
<span class="corr" id="xd25e871" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>had from time immemorial supplied
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>the silver ball. We are informed, on good
authority, that a Shepherd&rsquo;s family, of the name of Edwards, held
one of the cottages in Constantine for many generations under the
owners of Harlyn, by the annual render of a Cornish pie, made of
limpets, raisins, and sweet herbs, on the feast of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Constantine.&rdquo;&mdash;(Lysons&rsquo; <i>Magna
Britannia</i>.)</p>
<p>At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Day a fair was formerly held on
Good Friday, now changed to Easter Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Good Friday, 1878, I saw a brisk fair going on in the
little village of Perran Porth, Cornwall, not far from the curious
oratory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran, known as
Perranzabuloe.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>W. A. B. C.</abbr>, <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, April 23rd, 1881.)</p>
<p>But, although many still make this day a holiday, the churches are
now much better attended. Good Friday cross-buns of many kinds are sold
by the Cornish confectioners; some, highly spiced, are eaten hot with
butter and sugar; a commoner bun is simply washed over the top with
saffron, and has a few currants stuck on it. There is one peculiar, I
believe, to Penzance: it is made of a rich currant paste highly covered
with saffron; it is about an eighth of an inch thick, and four inches
in diameter, and is marked with a large cross that divides it into four
equal portions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some of our farmhouses the Good Friday bun may be seen
hanging to a string from the bacon-rack, slowly diminishing until the
return of the season replaces it by a fresh one. It is of sovereign
good in all manners of diseases afflicting the family or cattle. I have
more than once seen a little of this cake grated into a warm mash for a
sick cow.&rdquo;&mdash;(T. Q. Couch, Polperro.) There is a superstition
that bread made on this day never gets mouldy.</p>
<p>Many amateur gardeners sow their seeds on Good Friday; superstition
says then they will all grow. &ldquo;There is a widely known belief in
West Cornwall, that young ravens are always hatched on Good
Friday.&rdquo;&mdash;(T. Cornish, <i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W.
Antiquary</abbr></i>, October, 1887.)</p>
<p>On Easter Monday, at Penzance, it was the custom within the last
twenty years to bring out in the lower part of the town, before the
doors, tables, on which were placed thick gingerbread cakes with
raisins in them, cups and saucers, etc., to be raffled for with cups
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>dice, called here &ldquo;Lilly-bangers.&rdquo;
Fifty years since a man, nicknamed Harry Martillo, with his wife, the
&ldquo;lovelee,&rdquo; always kept one of these &ldquo;lilly-banger
stalls&rdquo; at Penzance on market day. He would call attention to his
gaming-table by shouting&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Europe, Ayshee, Afrikee, and
Amerikee,</p>
<p class="line">And come back and married the lovelee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">I have heard that both used tobacco in three ways, and
indulged freely in rum, also &ldquo;tom-trot&rdquo; (hardbake),
strongly flavoured with peppermint. Of course a lively market would
influence the dose, and as for &ldquo;lovelee,&rdquo; it must have been
in Harry&rsquo;s partial eyes.&mdash;(<abbr>H.R.C.</abbr>)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="en">Upon little Easter Sunday, the freeholders of
the towne and mannour of Lostwithiel, by themselves or their deputies,
did there assemble, amongst whom one (as it fell to his lot by turne),
bravely apparelled, gallantly mounted, with a crowne on his head, a
scepter in his hand, a sword borne before him, and dutifully attended
by all the rest also on horseback, ride thorow the principal streete to
the Church; there the Curate in his best &lsquo;<i>beseene</i>&rsquo;
solemne receiud him at the Church-yard stile, and conducted him to
heare diuine seruice; after which he repaired with the same pompe to a
house fore-prouided for that purpose, made a feast to his attendants,
kept the table&rsquo;s end himselfe, and was serued with kneeling,
assay, and all other rites due to the estate of a Prince; with which
dinner the ceremony ended, and every man returned home
again.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Carew.)</p>
<p>The ancient custom of choosing a mock mayor was observed at
Lostwithiel, on 10th October, 1884, by torchlight, in the presence of
nearly a thousand people. The origin of both these customs is now quite
forgotten. &ldquo;A custom still existing at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> John&rsquo;s, Helston, and also at Buryan. The last
mayor of the Quay, Penzance, was Mr. Robinson, a noted authority on sea
fishing, etc. He died about ten years
ago.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>H.R.C.</abbr>)</p>
<p>April 1st. The universal attempts at fooling on this day are carried
on in Cornwall as elsewhere, and children are sent by their
schoolfellows for penn&rsquo;orths of pigeon&rsquo;s milk, memory
powder, strap-oil, etc., or with a note telling the receiver &ldquo;to
send the fool <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>farther.&rdquo; When one boy succeeds in taking in
another, he shouts after him, Fool! fool! the &ldquo;guckaw&rdquo;
(cuckoo).</p>
<p>Towednack&rsquo;s (a village near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives) &ldquo;Cuckoo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Crowder&rdquo; feast is on the
nearest Sunday to the 28th April. Tradition accounts for the first name
by the story of a man who there gave a feast on an inclement day in the
end of April. To warm his guests he threw some faggots on the fire (or
some furze-bushes), when a cuckoo flew out of them, calling
&ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; It was caught and kept, and he resolved
every year to invite his friends to celebrate the event. This, too, is
said to be the origin of the feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crowder&rdquo; in Cornwall means a fiddler, and the fiddle is
called a &ldquo;crowd.&rdquo; In former days the parishioners of
Towednack were met at the church door on &ldquo;feasten&rdquo; day by a
&ldquo;crowder,&rdquo; who, playing on his &ldquo;crowd,&rdquo; headed
a procession through the village street, hence its second name.</p>
<p>The only May-pole now erected in Cornwall is put up on April 30th,
at Hugh Town, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s, Scilly.
Girls dance round it on May-day with garlands of flowers on their
heads, or large wreaths of flowers from shoulder to waist. Dr. Stephen
Clogg, of Looe, says that &ldquo;May-poles are still to be seen on
May-day, at Pelynt, Dulver, and East and West
Looe.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W.
Antiquary</abbr></i>, August, 1884.) In the beginning of this century,
boys and girls in Cornwall sat up until twelve o&rsquo;clock on the eve
of May-day, and then marched around the towns and villages with Musical
Instruments, collecting their friends to go a-maying. May-day is
ushered in at Penzance by the discordant blowing of large tin horns. At
daybreak, and even earlier, parties of boys, five or six in number,
assemble at the street corners, from whence they perambulate the town
blowing their horns and conchshells. They enter the gardens of detached
houses, stop and bray under the <span class="corr" id="xd25e959" title=
"Source: bedroom">bed-room</span> windows, and beg for money. With what
they collect they go into the country, and at one of the farmhouses
they breakfast on bread and clotted cream, junket, &amp;c. An
additional ring of tin (a penn&rsquo;orth) is added to his horn every
year that a boy uses it.</p>
<p>Formerly, on May-morn, if the boys succeeded in fixing a &ldquo;May
bough&rdquo; over a farmer&rsquo;s door before he was up, he was
considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>bound to give them their breakfasts; and in some
parts of the county, should the first comer bring with him a piece of
well-opened hawthorn, he was entitled to a basin of cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In West Cornwall it is the custom to hang a piece of furze to
a door early in the morning of May-day. At breakfast-time the one who
does this appears and demands a piece of bread and cream with a basin
of &lsquo;raw-milk&rsquo; (milk that has not been scalded and the cream
taken off).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Landrake, East Cornwall, it was the custom to give the
person who plucked a fern as much cream as would cover it. It was also
a practice there to chastise with stinging nettles any one found in bed
after six on May-morning.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle, Vicar, Godolphin.)</p>
<p>Young shoots of sycamore, as well as white thorn, are known as May
in Cornwall, and from green twigs of the former and from green stalks
of wheaten corn the children of this county make a rude whistle, which
they call a &ldquo;feeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until very lately parties of young men and women rose betimes on
May-day and went into the country to breakfast; going a &ldquo;a
junketing&rdquo; in the evening has not yet been discontinued.</p>
<p>At Hayle, on May-day (1883), as usual, groups of children, decorated
with flowers and gay with fantastic paper-clothes, went singing through
the streets. In the evening bonfires were lit in various parts of the
town, houses were illuminated with candles, torches and fire-balls
burnt until a late hour. The last is a new and dangerous plaything: a
ball of tow or rags is saturated with petroleum, set fire to, and then
kicked from one place to another; it leaves a small track of burning
oil wherever it goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On May-morning, in Polperro, the children and even adults go
out into the country and fetch home branches of the narrow-leaved elm,
or flowering boughs of white thorn, both of which are called
&lsquo;May.&rsquo; At a later hour all the boys sally forth with
bucket, can, or other vessel, and avail themselves of a license which
the season confers&mdash;to &lsquo;dip&rsquo; or wellnigh drown,
without regard to person or circumstance, the passenger who has not the
protection of a piece of &lsquo;May&rsquo; conspicuously stuck in his
dress; at the same time they sing, &lsquo;The first of May is
Dipping-day.&rsquo; This manner of keeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>May-day
is, I have heard, common in Cornwall. We are now favoured with a call
from the boy with his pretty garland, gay with bright flowers and
gaudily-painted birds&rsquo;-eggs, who expects some little gratuity for
the sight.&rdquo;&mdash;(T. Q. Couch.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;At East and West Looe the boys dress their hats with flowers,
furnish themselves with bullocks&rsquo; horns, in which sticks of two
feet long are fixed, and with these filled with water they parade the
streets and dip all persons who have not the sprig of May in their
hats.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bond.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of May you must take down all the horse-shoes (that are
nailed over doors to keep out witches, &amp;c.) and turn them, not
letting them touch the ground.&rdquo;&mdash;(Old farmer, Mid-Cornwall,
through T. Q. Couch, <i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W.
Antiquary</abbr></i>, September, 1883.)</p>
<p>May-day at Padstow is Hobby-horse day. A hobby-horse is carried
through the streets to a pool known as Traitor&rsquo;s-pool, a quarter
of a mile out of the town. Here it is supposed to drink: the head is
dipped into the water, which is freely sprinkled over the spectators.
The procession returns home, singing a song to commemorate the
tradition that the French, having landed in the bay, mistook a party of
mummers in red cloaks for soldiers, hastily fled to their boats and
rowed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The May-pole on the first of May at Padstow has only been
discontinued within the last six or eight years (1883). It was erected
in connection with the &lsquo;Hobby-horse&rsquo; festival by the young
men of the town, who on the last eve of April month would go into the
country, cut a quantity of blooming yellow furze, and gather the
flowers then in season, make garlands of the same; borrow the largest
spar they could get from the shipwright&rsquo;s yard, dress it up with
the said furze and garlands, with a flag or two on the top, and hoist
the pole in a conspicuous part of the town, when the
&lsquo;Mayers,&rsquo; male and female, would dance around it on that
festival-day, singing&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;And strew all your flowers, for summer is come
in to-day.</p>
<p class="line">It is but a while ago since we have strewed ours</p>
<p class="line">In the merry morning of May,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The May-pole was allowed to remain up from a
week to a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>fortnight, when it was taken down, stripped, and
the pole returned.&rdquo;&mdash;(Henry Harding, Padstow,
<i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, August,
1883.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly all the respectable people at Padstow kept this
anniversary, decorated with the choicest flowers; but some unlucky day
a number of rough characters from a distance joined in it, and
committed some sad assaults upon old and young, spoiling all their nice
summer clothes, and covering their faces and persons with smut. From
that time&mdash;fifty years since&mdash;(1865) the procession is formed
of the lowest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The May-pole was once decorated with the best flowers, now
with only some elm-branches and furze in blossom. The horse is formed
as follows: The dress is made of sackcloth painted black&mdash;a fierce
mask&mdash;eyes red, horse&rsquo;s head, horse-hair mane and tail;
distended by a hoop&mdash;some would call it frightful. Carried by a
powerful man, he could inflict much mischief with the snappers, &amp;c.
No doubt it is a remnant of the ancient plays, and it represents the
devil, or the power of darkness. They commence singing at sunrise.</p>

<p>Mr. Rawlings all through his song has written &ldquo;For summer has
come unto day,&rdquo; but this is clearly a mistake. He also gives
another which he calls the &ldquo;May-Song,&rdquo; but it is not as

that sung at the Helston Hal-an-tow.</p>
<p>Mr. George C. Boase, in an article on &ldquo;The Padstow

found in the Cornish histories is in Hitchins and Drew&rsquo;s
<i>Cornwall</i> (vol. i., p. 720; vol. ii., pp. 525, 529), where it is
stated that there is a tradition of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George on horseback having visited the neighbourhood of Padstow, where
the indentation of his horse&rsquo;s hoofs caused a spring of water to
arise. The spot is still known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George&rsquo;s well, and water is said to be found there even in the
hottest summer.&mdash;(<i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W.
Antiquary</abbr></i>.)</p>
<p>In East Cornwall they have a custom of bathing in the sea on the
three first Sunday mornings in May. And in West Cornwall children were
taken before sunrise on those days to the holy wells, notably to that
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maddern (Madron), near Penzance, to
be there dipped into the running water, that they might be cured of the
rickets and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>other childish disorders. After being stripped
naked they were plunged three times into the water, the parents facing
the sun, and passed round the well nine times from east to west. They
were then dressed, and laid by the side of the well, or on an
artificial mound re-made every year, called <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Maddern&rsquo;s bed, which faced it, to sleep in the
sun: should they do so and the water bubble it was considered a good
sign. Not a word was to be spoken the whole time for fear of breaking
the spell.</p>
<p>A small piece torn (not cut) from the child&rsquo;s clothes was hung
for luck (if possible out of sight) on a thorn which grew out of the
chapel wall. Some of these bits of rag may still sometimes be found
fluttering on the neighbouring bushes. I knew two well-educated people
who in 1840, having a son who could not walk at the age of two, carried
him and dipped him in Madron well (a distance of three miles from their
home,) on the first two Sundays in May; but on the third the father
refused to go. Some authorities say this well should be visited on the
first three Wednesdays in May; as was for the same purpose another holy
well at Chapel Euny (or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Uny) near
Sancred.</p>
<p>The Wesleyans hold an open-air service on the first three Sunday
afternoons in May, at a ruined chapel near Madron well, in the south
wall of which a hole may be seen, through which the water from the well
runs into a small baptistry in the south-west corner.</p>
<p>Parties of young girls to this day walk there in May to try for
sweethearts. Crooked pins, or small heavy things, are dropped into the
well in couples; if they keep together the pair will be married; the
number of bubbles they make in falling shows the time that will elapse
before the event. Sometimes two pieces of straw formed into a cross,
fastened in the centre by a pin, were used in these divinations. An old
woman who lived in a cottage at a little distance formerly frequented
the well and instructed visitors how to work the charms; she was never
paid in money, but small presents were placed where she could find
them. Pilgrims from all parts of England centuries ago resorted to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maddern&rsquo;s well: that was famed, as
was also her grave, for many miraculous cures. The late <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. S. Hawker, Vicar of Morwenstow, in East
Cornwall, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>published a poem, called &ldquo;The Doom Well of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Madron,&rdquo; on one of the ancient
legends connected with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A respectable tradesman&rsquo;s wife in Launceston tells me
that the townspeople here say that a swelling in the neck may be cured
by the patients going before sunrise on the first of May to the grave
of the last young man (if the patient be a woman), to that of the last
young woman (if a man) who had been buried in the churchyard, and
applying the dew, gathered by passing the hand three times from the
head to the foot of the grave, to the part affected by the ailment. I
may as well add that the common notion of improving the complexion by
washing the face with the early dew in the fields on the first of May
prevails in these parts (East Cornwall), and they say that a child who
is weak in the back may be cured by drawing him over the grass wet with
the morning dew. The experiment must be thrice performed, that is, on
the mornings of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of May.&rdquo;&mdash;(<abbr>H. G.
T.</abbr>, <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 14th December, 1850.)</p>
<p>The 8th of May is at Helston given up to pleasure, and is known as
Flora-day, Flurry-day, Furry-day, and Faddy. To &ldquo;fade&rdquo;
meant in old English to dance from country to town. A legend says this
day was set apart to commemorate a fight between the devil and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, in which the first was
defeated. The name Helston has been fancifully derived from a large
block of granite which until 1783 was to be seen in the yard of the
Angel hotel, the principal inn of the place. This was the stone that
sealed Hell&rsquo;s mouth, and the devil was carrying it when met by
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael. Why he should have burdened
himself with such a &ldquo;large pebble&rdquo; (as Cornish miners call
all stones) is quite unknown. The fight and overthrow are figured on
the town-seal.</p>
<p>The week before Flora-day is in Helston devoted to the
&ldquo;spring-clean,&rdquo; and every house is made &ldquo;as bright as
a new pin,&rdquo; and the gardens stripped of their flowers to adorn
them.</p>
<p>The revelry begins at day-break, when the men and maidservants with
their friends go into the country to breakfast; these are the
&ldquo;Hal-an-tow.&rdquo; They return about eight, laden with green
boughs, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=

</div>
<p class="first">The whole of this song may be found with the music in
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Baring Gould&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Songs of the West,&rdquo; and the first verse set to another
tune in <i>Specimens of Cornish Provincial Dialect</i>, by Uncle Jan
Trenoodle. (Sandys.)</p>
<p>The Hal-an-tow are privileged to levy contributions on strangers
coming into the town.</p>
<p>Early in the morning merry peals are rung on the church-bells, and
at nine a prescriptive holiday is demanded by the boys at the
grammar-school. At noon the principal inhabitants and visitors dance
through the town. The dancers start from the market-house, and go
through the streets; in at the front doors of the houses that have been
left open for them, ringing every bell and knocking at every knocker,
and out at the back, but if more convenient they dance around the
garden, or even around a room, and return through the door by which
they entered. Sometimes the procession files in at one shop-door,
dances through that department and out through another, and in one
place descends into a cellar. All the main streets are thus traversed,
and a circuit is made of the bowling-green, which at one end is the
extreme limit of the town. Two beadles, their wands wreathed with
flowers, and a band with a gaily-decorated drum, head the procession.
The dance ends with &ldquo;hands across&rdquo; at the assembly room of
the Angel hotel, where there is always a ball in the evening.
Non-dancers are admitted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>this room by a small payment (which
must be a silver coin), paid as they go up the stairs either to the
landlord or a gentleman,&mdash;one stands on each side of the door. The
gentlemen dancers on entering pay for their partners, and by
established custom, should they be going to attend the evening ball,
they are bound to give them their tickets, gloves, and the first dance.
The tradespeople have their dance at a later hour, and their ball at
another hotel.</p>
<p>The figure of the Furry dance, performed to a very lively measure,
is extremely simple. To the first half of the tune the couples dance
along hand-in-hand; at the second the first gentleman turns the second
lady and the second gentleman the first. This change is made all down
the set. Repeat.</p>
<p>I have appended the tune, to which children have adopted the
following doggerel:&mdash;</p>
<div class="figure musicwidth"><img src="images/music.png" alt=
"Music score." width="545" height="151"></div>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;John the bone (beau) was walking home,</p>
<p class="line xd25e1242">When he met with Sally Dover,</p>
<p class="line">He kissed her once, he kissed her twice,</p>
<p class="line xd25e1242">And he kissed her three times
over.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Some writers have made the mistake of imagining that
the tune sung to the Hal-an-tow and the Furry dance are the same.</p>
<p>Formerly, should any person in Helston be found at work on
Flora-day, he was set astride on a pole, then carried away on
men&rsquo;s shoulders to a wide part of the Cober (a stream which
empties itself into Loe-pool close by), and sentenced to leap over it.
As it was almost impossible to do this without jumping into the water,
the punishment was remitted by the payment of a small fine towards the
day&rsquo;s amusement. Others say the offender was first made to jump
the Cober and then set astride on a pole to dry. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>In many of the villages around Helston the children, on Flora-day,
deck themselves with large wreaths, which they wear over one shoulder
and under the other arm; and at Porthleven I observed, in 1884, in
addition to these wreaths, several children with large white
handkerchiefs arranged as wimples, kept on their heads with garlands of
flowers.</p>
<p>One of the first objects on entering the village of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Germans (East Cornwall) is the large walnut-tree, at
the foot of what is called Nut-tree Hill. Many a gay May-fair has been
witnessed by the old tree. In the morning of the 28th of the month
splendid fat cattle from some of the largest and best farms in the
county quietly chewed the cud around its trunk; in the afternoon the
basket-swing dangled from its branches filled with merry, laughing boys
and girls from every part of the parish. On the following day the mock
mayor, who had been chosen with many formalities, remarkable only for
their rude and rough nature, starting from some
&ldquo;bush-house&rdquo; where he had been supping too freely of the
fair-ale, was mounted on wain or cart, and drawn around it, to claim
his pretended jurisdiction over the ancient borough, until his
successor was chosen at the following fair. Leaving the nut-tree, which
is a real ornament to the town, we pass by a spring of water running
into a large trough, in which many a country lad has been drenched for
daring to enter the town on the 29th of May without the leaf or branch
of oak in his hat.&mdash;(R. Hunt, <abbr title=
"Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr>, <i>Drolls, &amp;c., Old
Cornwall</i>.)</p>
<p>The wrestlers of Cornwall and their wrestling-matches are still
famous, and in the May of 1868 4,000 assembled one day on Marazion
Green, and 3,000 the next, to see one. The wrestlers of this county
have a peculiar grip, called by them &ldquo;the Cornish-hug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any odd, foolish game is in West Cornwall called a May-game
(pronounced May-gum), also a person who acts foolishly; and you
frequently hear the expression&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar
May-gum!&rdquo; There is a proverb that says&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
make mock of a May-gum, you may be struck comical yourself one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whit-Sunday.&mdash;It was formerly considered very unlucky in
Cornwall to go out on this day without putting on some new thing.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>Children were told that should they do so
&ldquo;the birds would foul them as they walked along.&rdquo; A new
ribbon, or even a shoe-lace, would be sufficient to protect them.
Whit-Monday is generally kept as a holiday, and is often made an excuse
for another country excursion, which, if taken in the afternoon, ends
at some farm-house with a tea of Cornish &ldquo;heavy-cream
cake,&rdquo; followed (in the evening) by a junket with
clotted-cream.</p>
<p>Carew speaks of a feast kept in his time on Whit-Monday at the
&ldquo;Church-house&rdquo; of the different parishes called a
&ldquo;Church-ale.&rdquo; It was a sort of large picnic, for which
money had been previously collected by two young
men&mdash;&ldquo;wardens,&rdquo; who had been previously appointed the
preceding year by their last &ldquo;foregoers.&rdquo; This custom has
long ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The Wesleyans (Methodists) in Cornwall hold an open-air service on
Whit-Monday at Gwennap-pit. The pit is an old earth-round, excavated in
the hill-side of Carn Marth, about three miles from the small village
of Gwennap, and one from Redruth. This amphitheatre, which is then
usually filled, is capable of holding from four to five thousand
people, and is in shape like a funnel. It is encircled from the bottom
to the top with eighteen turf-covered banks, made by cutting the earth
into steps. It is admirably adapted for sound, and the voice of the
preacher, who stands on one side, about half way up, is distinctly
heard by the whole congregation. Wesley, when on a visit to Cornwall,
preached in Gwennap-pit to the miners of that district, and this was
the origin of the custom. Many excursion-trains run to Redruth on
Whit-Monday, and a continuous string of vehicles of every description,
as well as pedestrians, may be seen wending their way from the station
to the pit, which is almost surrounded by &ldquo;downs,&rdquo; and in a
road close by rows of &ldquo;standings&rdquo; (stalls) are erected for
the sale of &ldquo;fairings.&rdquo; An annual pleasure-fair goes on at
the same time at Redruth, and many avail themselves of the
excursion-trains who have not the least intention of attending the
religious service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Mid-Cornwall, in the second week of June, at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Roche and in one or two adjacent parishes, a curious
dance is performed at their annual &lsquo;feasts.&rsquo; It enjoys the
rather undignified name of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>&lsquo;Snails&rsquo; creep,&rsquo;
but would be more properly called &lsquo;The Serpent&rsquo;s
Coil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is scarcely a perfect description of
it:&mdash;The young people being all assembled in a large meadow, the
village band strikes up a simple but lively air, and marches forward,
followed by the whole assemblage, leading hand-in-hand (or more closely
linked in case of engaged couples), the whole keeping time to the tune
with a lively step. The band or head of the serpent keeps marching in
an ever-narrowing circle, whilst its train of dancing followers becomes
coiled around it in circle after circle. It is now that the most
interesting part of the dance commences, for the band, taking a sharp
turn about, begins to retrace the circle, still followed as before, and
a number of young men with long, leafy branches in their hands as
standards, direct this counter-movement with almost military
precision.&rdquo;&mdash;(W. C. Wade, <i><abbr title=
"Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, April, 1881.)</p>
<p>A game similar to the above dance is often played by Sunday-school
children in West Cornwall, at their out-of-door summer-treats, called
by them &ldquo;roll-tobacco.&rdquo; They join hands in one long line,
the taller children at the head. The first child stands still, whilst
the others in ever-narrowing circles dance around singing, until they
are coiled into a tight mass. The outer coil then wheels sharply in a
contrary direction, followed by the remainder, retracing their
steps.</p>
<p>23rd of June. In the afternoon of Midsummer-eve little girls may be
still occasionally met in the streets of Penzance with garlands of
flowers on their heads, or wreaths over one shoulder.</p>
<p>This custom was, within the last fifty years, generally observed in
West Cornwall. And in all the streets of our towns and villages groups
of graceful girls, rich as well as poor, all dressed in white, their
frocks decorated with rows of laurel-leaves (&ldquo;often spangled with
gold-leaf&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell), might in the afternoon have been seen
standing at the doors, or in the evening dancing along with their
brothers or lovers.</p>
<p>In Penzance, and in nearly all the parishes of West Penwith,
immediately after nightfall on the eves of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> John and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, the
23rd and 28th of June, lines of tar-barrels, occasionally broken by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>bonfires, were simultaneously lighted in all the
streets, whilst, at the same time, bonfires were kindled on all the
cairns and hills around Mount&rsquo;s Bay, throwing the outlines in
bold relief against the sky. &ldquo;Then the villagers, linked in
circles hand-in-hand, danced round them to preserve themselves against
witchcraft, and, when they burnt low, one person here and there
detached himself from the rest and leaped through the flames to insure
himself from some special evil. The old people counted these fires and
drew a presage from them.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bottrell.)</p>
<p>Regularly at dusk the mayor of Penzance sent the town-crier through
the streets to give notice that no fireworks were allowed to be let off
in the town; but this was done simply that he should not be held
responsible if any accident happened, for he and all in Penzance knew
quite well that the law would be set at defiance. Large numbers of men,
women, and boys came up soon after from the quay and lower parts of the
town swinging immense torches around their heads; these torches
(locally known as &ldquo;to&rsquo;ches&rdquo;) were made of pieces of
canvas about two feet square, fastened in the middle either to a long
pole or a strong chain, dipped until completely saturated in tar. Of
course they required to be swung with great dexterity or the holder
would have been burnt. The heat they gave out was something dreadful,
and the smoke suffocating. Most of the inhabitants dressed in their
oldest clothes congregated in groups in the street, and a great part of
the fun of the evening consisted in slyly throwing squibs amongst them,
or in dispersing them by chasing them with hand-rockets. The greatest
good humour always prevailed, and although the revellers were thickest
in a small square surrounded by houses, some of them thatched, very few
accidents have ever happened. A band stationed here played at
intervals. No set-pieces were ever put off, but there were a few
Roman-candles. Between ten and eleven a popular mayor might often have
been seen standing in the middle of this square (the Green Market),
encircled by about a dozen young men, each holding a lighted
hand-rocket over the mayor&rsquo;s head. The sparks which fell around
him on all sides made him look as if he stood in the centre of a
fountain of fire. The proceedings finished by the boys and girls
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>from the quay, whose torches had by this time
expired, dancing in a long line hand in hand through the streets, in
and out and sometimes over the now low burning tar-barrels, crying out,
&ldquo;An eye, an eye.&rdquo; At this shout the top couple held up
their arms, and, beginning with the last, the others ran under them,
thus reversing their position. A year or two ago, owing to the
increasing traffic at Penzance, the practice of letting off squibs and
crackers in the streets was formally abolished by order of the mayor
and corporation. Efforts are still made and money collected for the
purpose of reviving it, with some little success; but the Green Market
is no longer the scene of the fun. A few boys still after dusk swing
their torches, and here and there some of the old inhabitants keep up
the custom of lighting tar-barrels or bonfires before their doors. A
rite called the Bonfire Test was formerly celebrated on this night. Mr.
R. Hunt, <abbr title="Fellow of the Royal Society">F.R.S.</abbr>, has
described it in his <i>Drolls, &amp;c. Old Cornwall</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;A
bonfire is formed of faggots of furze, ferns, and the like. Men and
maidens, by locking hands, form a circle, and commence a dance to some
wild native song. At length, as the dancers become excited, they pull
each other from side to side across the fire. If they succeed in
treading out the fire without breaking the chain, none of the party
will die during the year. If, however, the ring is broken before the
fire is extinguished, &lsquo;bad luck to the weak hands,&rsquo; as my
informant said (1865). All the witches in West Cornwall used to meet at
midnight on Midsummer-eve at Trewa (pronounced Troway), in the parish
of Zennor, and around the dying fires renewed their vows to their
master, the Devil. Zennor boasts of some of the finest coast scenery in
Cornwall, and many remarkable rocks were scattered about in this
neighbourhood; several of them (as does the cromlech) still remain, but
others have been quarried and carted away, amongst them one known as
Witches&rsquo; Rock, which if touched nine times at midnight kept away
ill-luck, and prevented people from being &lsquo;over-looked&rsquo;
(ill-wished).&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Midsummer-day (June 24th) two pleasure fairs are held in
Cornwall: one at Pelynt, in the eastern part of the county, where in
the evening, from time immemorial, a large bonfire has been always
lighted in an adjoining field by the boys of the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>(some writers fix on the summer solstice as the
date of Pelynt fair, but this, I believe, is an error); and the second
on the old quay at Penzance. It is called &ldquo;Quay Fair,&rdquo; to
distinguish it from Corpus Christi fair, another and much larger one
held at the other extremity of the town, and which lasts from the eve
of Corpus Christi until the following Saturday. Quay fair was formerly
crowded by people from the neighbouring inland towns and villages;
their principal amusement was to go out for a short row, a great number
in one boat, the boatmen charging a penny a head. This was taking a
&ldquo;Pen&rsquo;nord of Say.&rdquo; When not paid for, a short row is
a &ldquo;Troil.&rdquo; (Troil is Old-Cornish for a feast).</p>
<p>Although this fair has not yet been discontinued, the number of
those attending it grows less and less every year, and not enough money
is taken to encourage travelling showmen to set up their booths. The
old charter allowed the public-houses at the quay to keep open all
night on the 24th of June, but such is no longer the case. Quay fair
was sometimes known as Strawberry fair, and thirty years ago many
strawberries were sold at it for twopence a quart. They were not
brought to market in pottles, but in large baskets containing some
gallons, and were measured out to the customers in a tin pint or quart
measure. They were eaten from cabbage-leaves. Before the end of the
day, unless there were a brisk sale, the fruit naturally got much
bruised. They are still sold in the same way, but are not nearly as
plentiful. Many of the strawberry fields, through which the public
footpaths often went, have been turned up, and are now used for growing
early potatoes. On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John&rsquo;s-day
Cornish miners place a green bough on the shears of the engine-houses
in commemoration of his preaching in the wilderness.</p>
<p>This day is with Cornish as with other maidens a favourite one for
trying old love-charms. Some of them rise betimes, and go into the
country to search for an even &ldquo;leafed&rdquo; ash, or an even
&ldquo;leafed&rdquo; clover. When found, the rhymes they repeat are
common to all England.</p>
<p>An old lady, a native of Scilly, once gave me a most graphic
description of her mother and aunt laying a table, just before midnight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John&rsquo;s-day, with a clean white cloth, knives and forks, and bread
and cheese, to see if they should marry the men to whom they were
engaged. They sat down to it, keeping strict silence&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;For, if a word had been spoken,</p>
<p class="line">The spell would have been broken.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As the clock struck twelve, the door (which had
purposely been left unbarred) opened, and their two lovers walked in,
having, as they said, met outside, both compelled by irresistible
curiosity to go and see if there were anything the matter with their
sweethearts.</p>
<p>It never entered the old lady&rsquo;s head that the men probably had
an inkling of what was going on, and to have hinted that such was the
case would, I am quite sure, have given dire offence.</p>
<p>The following charm is from the <i><abbr title=
"Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>:&mdash;Pluck a rose at
midnight on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John&rsquo;s-day, wear it to
church, and your intended will take it out of your
button-hole.&mdash;(Old Farmer, Mid-Cornwall, through T. Q. Couch.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was believed that if a young maiden gathered a rose on
Midsummer-day, and folding it in white paper, forbore to look at it or
mention what she had done until the following Christmas-day, she would
<i>then</i> find the flower fresh and bright; and further if she placed
it in her bosom and wore it at church, the person most worthy of her
hand would be sure to draw near her in the porch, and beseech her to
give him the rose.&rdquo;&mdash;Neota&mdash;Launcells. Charlotte
Hawkey.</p>
<p>In connection with Midsummer bonfires, I mentioned those on
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s-eve; although they are no
longer lighted at Penzance, the custom (never confined to West
Cornwall) is in other places still observed. Many of the churches in
the small fishing villages on the coast are dedicated to this saint,
the patron of fishermen, and on his tide the towers of these churches
were formerly occasionally illuminated.</p>
<p>On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s-eve, at Newlyn West,
in 1883, many of the men were away fishing on the east coast of
England, and the celebration of the festival was put off until their
return, when it took place with more than usual rejoicings. The
afternoon was given up to aquatic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>sports, and in the evening, in
addition to the usual bonfires and tar-barrels, squibs, hand and
sky-rockets were let off. The young people finished the day with an
open-air dance, which ended before twelve. In this village effigies of
objectionable characters, after they have been carried through the
streets, are sometimes burnt in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter&rsquo;s bonfire. I have often in Cornwall heard red-haired people
described &ldquo;as looking as if they were born on bonfire
night.&rdquo; At Wendron, and many other small inland mining villages,
the boys at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s-tide fire off
miniature rock batteries called &ldquo;plugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must now again quote from Mr. T. Q. Couch, and give his account of
how this day is observed at Polperro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patron saint of Polperro is <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, to whom the church, built on the seaward hill
(still called chapel hill) was dedicated. His festival is kept on the
10th of July (old style). At Peter&rsquo;s-tide is our annual feast or
fair. Though a feeble and insignificant matter, it is still with the
young the great event of the year. On the eve of the fair is the
prefatory ceremony of a bonfire. The young fishermen go from house to
house and beg money to defray the expenses. At nightfall a large pile
of faggots and tar-barrels is built on the beach, and, amid the cheers
of a congregated crowd of men, women, and children (for it is a favour
never denied to children to stay up and see the bonfire), the pile is
lighted. The fire blazes up, and men and boys dance merrily round it,
and keep up the sport till the fire burns low enough, when they
venturously leap through the flames. It is a most animated scene, the
whole valley lit up by the bright red glow, bringing into strong relief
front and gable of picturesque old houses, each window crowded with
eager and delighted faces, while around the fire is a crowd of ruddy
lookers-on, shutting in a circle of impish figures leaping like
salamanders through the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day the fair begins, a trivial matter, except to the
children, who are dressed in their Sunday clothes, and to the village
girls in their best gowns and gaudiest ribbons. Stalls, or
&lsquo;standings,&rsquo; laden with fairings, sweetmeats, and toys,
line the lower part of Lansallos Street, near the strand. There are,
besides, strolling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45</a>]</span>Thespians; fellows who draw unwary youths
into games of hazard, where the risk is mainly on one side;
ballad-singers; <i>penny-peep</i> men, who show and describe to
wondering boys the most horrid scenes of the latest murder; jugglers
and tumblers also display their skill. In the neighbouring inn the
fiddler plays his liveliest tunes at twopence a reel, which the swains
gallantly pay. The first day of the fair is merely introductory, for
the excitement is rarely allayed under three. The second day is much
livelier than the first, and has for its great event the
wrestling-match on the strand, or perhaps a boat-race. On the third day
we have the mayor-choosing, never a valid ceremony, but a broad
burlesque. The person who is chosen to this post of mimic dignity is
generally some half-witted or drunken fellow, who, tricked out in
tinsel finery, elects his staff of constables, and these, armed with
staves, accompany his chariot (some jowster&rsquo;s huckster&rsquo;s
cart, dressed with green boughs) through the town, stopping at each
inn, where he makes a speech full of large promises to his listeners,
of full work, better wages, and a liberal allowance of beer during his
year of mayoralty. He then demands a quart of the landlord&rsquo;s ale,
which is gauged with mock ceremony, and if adjudged short of measure
is, after being emptied, broken on the wheel of the car. Having
completed the perambulation of the town, his attendants often make some
facetious end of the pageant by wheeling the mayor in his chariot with
some impetus into the tide.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Polperro</i>, 1871, pp.
156&ndash;159.</p>
<p>The ceremony of choosing a mock mayor was also observed at Penryn
(near Falmouth), but it took place in the autumn, on a day in September
or October, when hazel-nuts were ripe, and &ldquo;nutting day&rdquo;
was kept by the children and poor people. The journeymen tailors went
from Penryn and Falmouth to Mylor parish, on the opposite side of the
river Fal. There they made choice of the wittiest among them to fill
that office. His title was the &ldquo;Mayor of Mylor.&rdquo; When
chosen, he was borne in a chair upon the shoulders of four strong men
from his &ldquo;<span lang="en">goode towne of Mylor</span>&rdquo; to
his &ldquo;<span lang="en">anciente borough of Penryn</span>.&rdquo; He
was preceded by torch-bearers and two town-sergeants, in gowns and
cocked hats, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>cabbages instead of maces, and surrounded by
a guard armed with staves. Just outside Penryn he was met with a band
of music, which played him into the town. The procession halted at the
town-hall, where the mayor made a burlesque speech, often a clever
imitation of the phrases and manners of their then sitting
parliamentary representative. This speech was repeated with variations
before the different inns, the landlords of which were expected to
provide the mayor and his numerous attendants liberally with beer. The
day&rsquo;s proceedings finished with a dinner at one of the
public-houses in Penryn. Bonfires, &amp;c., were lighted, and fireworks
let off soon after dusk. It was popularly believed that this choosing
of a mock mayor was permitted by a clause in the town charter.</p>
<p>A festival, supposed to have been instituted in honour of
Thomas-&agrave;-Beckett, called &ldquo;Bodmin-Riding,&rdquo; was
(although shorn of its former importance) until very recently held
there on the first Monday and Tuesday after the 7th of July.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this century all the tradespeople of the town,
preceded by music and carrying emblems of their trades, walked in
procession to the Priory. They were headed by two men, one with a
garland and the other with a pole, which they presented and received
back again from the master of the house as the then representative of
the Prior. Mr. T. Q. Couch had the following description of this
ceremony from those who took part in its latest celebration:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A puncheon of beer having been brewed in the previous
October, and duly bottled in anticipation of the time, two or more
young men, who were entrusted with the chief management of the affair,
and who represented &lsquo;the Wardens&rsquo; of Carew&rsquo;s
Church-ales, went round the town (Bodmin) attended by a band of
drummers and fifers, or other instruments. The crier saluted each house
with&mdash;&lsquo;To the people of this house, a prosperous morning,
long life, health, and a merry riding.&rsquo; The musicians then struck
up the riding-tune, a quick and inspiriting measure, said by some to be
as old as the feast itself. The householder was solicited to taste the
riding-ale, which was carried round in baskets. A bottle was usually
taken in, and it was acknowledged by such a sum as the means or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>humour of the townsmen permitted, to be spent on
the public festivities of the season. Next morning a procession was
formed (all who could afford to ride mounted on horse or ass, smacking
long-lashed whips), first to the Priory to receive two large garlands
of flowers fixed on staves, and then in due order to the principal
streets to the town-end, where the games were formerly opened. The
sports, which lasted two days, were of the ordinary
sort&mdash;wrestling, foot-racing, jumping in sacks, &amp;c. It is
worthy of remark that a second or inferior brewing from the same wort
was drunk at a minor merry-making at Whitsuntide.&rdquo;&mdash;(Popular
Antiquities, <i>Journal Royal Institute of Cornwall</i>, 1864.)</p>
<p>In former days the proceedings ended in a servants&rsquo;-ball, at
which dancing was kept up until the next morning&rsquo;s
breakfast-hour.</p>
<p>A very curious carnival was originally held under a Lord of Misrule,
in July, on Halgaver Moor, near Bodmin, thus quaintly described by
Carew:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="en">The youthlyer sort of Bodmin townsmen vse to
sport themselves by playing the box with strangers whom they summon to
Halgauer. The name signifieth the Goat&rsquo;s Moore, and such a place
it is, lying a little without the towne, and very full of quauemires.
When these mates meet with any rawe seruing-man or other young master,
who may serue and deserue to make pastime, they cause him to be
solemnely arrested, for his appearance before the Maior of Halgauer,
where he is charged with wearing one spurre, or going vntrussed, or
wanting a girdle, or some such felony. After he had been arraygned and
tryed, with all requisite circumstances, iudgement is given in formal
terms, and executed in some one vngracious pranke or other, more to the
skorne than hurt of the party condemned. Hence is sprung the prouerb
when we see one slouenly appareled to say he shall be presented at
Halgauer Court (or take him before the Maior of Halgauer).</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="en">But now and then they extend this merriment
with the largest, to preiudice of ouer-credulous people, persuading
them to fight with a dragon lurking in Halgauer, or to see some strange
matter there, which concludeth at least with a trayning them into the
mire.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Survey of Cornwall.</i>) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>Heath says in his <i>Description of Cornwall</i>, &ldquo;These
sports and pastimes were so liked by King Charles II., when he touched
at Bodmin on his way to Scilly, that he became a brother of the jovial
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking-day.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;An old custom, about which
history tells us nothing, is still duly observed at Crowan, in West
Cornwall. Annually, on the Sunday evening previous to Praze-an-beeble
fair (July 16th) large numbers of the young folk repair to the parish
church, and at the conclusion of the service they hasten to Clowance
Park, where still large crowds assemble, collected chiefly from the
neighbouring villages of Leeds-town, Carnhell-green, Nancegollan,
Blackrock, and Praze. Here the sterner sex select their partners for
the forthcoming fair, and, as it not unfrequently happens that the
generous proposals are not accepted, a tussle ensues, to the intense
merriment of passing spectators. Many a happy wedding has resulted from
the opportunity afforded for selection on &lsquo;Taking-day&rsquo; in
Clowance Park.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Cornishman</i>, July, 1882.)</p>
<p>At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, on the 25th July,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James&rsquo;s-day, they hold a quiennial
celebration of the &ldquo;Knillian-games.&rdquo; These have been fully
described by the late J. S. Courtney in his <i>Guide to Penzance</i>,
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives a pyramid on the
summit of a hill attracts attention. This pyramid was erected in the
year 1782, as a place of sepulture for himself, by John Knill, Esq.,
some time collector of the Customs at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, and afterwards a resident in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, London, where he
died in 1811. The building is commonly called &lsquo;Knill&rsquo;s
Mausoleum&rsquo;; but Mr. Knill&rsquo;s body was not there deposited,
for, having died in London, he was, according to his own directions,
interred in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew&rsquo;s church,
Holborn. The pyramid bears on its three sides respectively the
following inscriptions, in relief, on the granite of which it is built:
&lsquo;Johannes Knill, 1782.&rsquo; &lsquo;I know that my Redeemer
liveth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Resurgam.&rsquo; On one side there is also Mr.
Knill&rsquo;s coat-of-arms, with his motto, &lsquo;<span lang="la">Nil
desperandum</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1797, Mr. Knill, by a deed of trust, settled upon
the mayor and capital burgesses of the borough of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and their successors for ever, an annuity of
ten pounds, as a rent-charge, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>be paid out of the manor of
Glivian, in the parish of Mawgan, in this county, to the said mayor and
burgesses in the town-hall of the said borough, at twelve o&rsquo;clock
at noon, on the feast of the Nativity of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John (Midsummer-day) in every year; and, in default, to be levied by
the said mayor and burgesses by distress on the said manor. The ten
pounds then received are to be immediately paid by the mayor and
burgesses to the mayor, the collector of customs, and the clergyman of
the parish for the time being, to be by them deposited in a chest
secured by three locks, of which each is to have a key; and the box is
left in the custody of the mayor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of this annuity a portion is directed to be applied to the
repair and support of the mausoleum; another sum for the establishment
of various ceremonies to be observed once every five years; and the
remainder &lsquo;to the effectuating and establishing of certain
charitable purposes.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole affair has, however, been generally treated with ridicule.
In order, therefore, to show that Mr. Knill intended a considerable
portion of his bequest to be applied to really useful purposes, we
annex a copy of his regulations for the disposal of the money:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First. That, at the end of every five years, on the feast-day
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James the Apostle, <i>Twenty</i>-five
pounds shall be expended as follows, viz. <i>Ten</i> pounds in a dinner
for the Mayor, Collector of Customs, and Clergyman, and two persons to
be invited by each of them, making a party of nine persons, to dine at
some tavern at the borough. <i>Five</i> pounds to be equally divided
among ten girls, natives of the borough, and daughters of seamen,
fishermen, or tinners, each of them not exceeding ten years of age, who
shall between ten and twelve o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon of that day
dance, for a quarter of hour at least, on the ground adjoining the
Mausoleum, and after the dance sing the 100th Psalm of the Old Version,
&lsquo;to the fine old tune&rsquo; to which the same was then sung in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>One</i> pound to the fiddler who shall play to the girls
while dancing and singing at the Mausoleum, and also before them on
their return home therefrom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Two</i> pounds to two widows of seamen, fishermen, or
tinners of the borough, being 64 years old or upwards, who shall attend
the dancing and singing of the girls, and walk before them immediately
after the fiddler, and certify to the Mayor, Collector, and Clergyman
that the ceremonies have been duly performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>One</i> pound to be laid out in white ribbons for
breast-knots for the girls and widows, and a cockade for the fiddler,
to be worn by them respectively on that day and the Sunday following.
<i>One</i> pound to purchase account-books from time to time and pay
the Clerk of the Customs for keeping the accounts. The remaining
<i>Five</i> pounds to be paid to a man and wife, widower, or widow, 60
years of age or upwards, the man being an inhabitant of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and a seaman, fisherman, tinner, or labourer,
who shall have bred up to the age of ten years and upwards, the
greatest number of legitimate children by his or her own labour, care,
and industry, without parochial assistance, or having become entitled
to any property in any other manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly. When a certain sum of money shall have accumulated
in the chest, over and above what may have been required for repairs of
the Mausoleum and the above payments, it is directed that on one of the
fore-mentioned days of the festival &lsquo;<i>Fifty</i>&rsquo; pounds
shall be distributed in addition to the
&lsquo;<i>Twenty-five</i>&rsquo; pounds spent quiennially in the
following manner; that is <i>Ten</i> pounds to be given as a
marriage-portion to the woman between 26 and 36 years old, being a
native of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, who shall have been
married to a seaman, fisherman, tinner, or labourer, residing in the
borough, between the 31st of December previously, and that day
following the said feast-day, that shall appear to the Mayor,
Collector, and Clergyman, the most worthy, &lsquo;regard being had to
her duty and kindness to her parents, or to her friends who have
brought her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Five</i> pounds to any woman, single or married, being an
inhabitant of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, who in the opinion
of the aforesaid gentlemen shall be the best knitter of
fishing-nets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Five</i> pounds to be paid to the woman, married or
single, inhabitant of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, or
otherwise, who shall, by the same authorities, be deemed to be the best
curer and packer of pilchards for exportation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Five</i> pounds to be given between such two follower-boys
as shall by the same gentlemen be judged to have best conducted
themselves of all the follower-boys in the several concerns, in the
preceding fishing-season. (A follower is a boat that carries a tuck-net
in pilchard-fishing.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>Twenty-five</i> pounds, the remainder of the said
<i>Fifty</i>, to be divided among all the Friendly Societies in the
borough, instituted for the support of the Members in sickness or other
calamity, in equal shares. If there be no such Society, the same to be
distributed among ten poor persons, five men and five women,
inhabitants of the borough, of the age of 64 years or upwards, and who
have never received parochial relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first celebration of the Knillian games, which drew a large
concourse of people, took place in Knill&rsquo;s lifetime on July 25th,
1801.</p>
<p>The chorus then sung by the 10 virgins was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Quit the bustle of the bay,</p>
<p class="line">Hasten, virgins, come away:</p>
<p class="line">Hasten to the mountain&rsquo;s brow,</p>
<p class="line">Leave, oh! leave, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives
below.</p>
<p class="line">Haste to breathe a purer air,</p>
<p class="line">Virgins fair, and pure as fair.</p>
<p class="line">Quit <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives and all her
treasures,</p>
<p class="line">Fly her soft voluptuous pleasures,</p>
<p class="line">Fly her sons and all the wiles</p>
<p class="line">Lurking in their wanton smiles;</p>
<p class="line">Fly her splendid midnight halls,</p>
<p class="line">Fly the revels of her balls,</p>
<p class="line">Fly, oh! fly, the chosen seat</p>
<p class="line">Where vanity and fashion meet!</p>
<p class="line">Thither hasten: form the ring,</p>
<p class="line">Round the tomb in chorus sing.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">These games have been repeated every five years up to
the present time.</p>
<p>Morvah feast, which is on the nearest Sunday to the 1st August, is
said to have been instituted in memory of a wrestling-match, throwing
of quoits, &amp;c., which took place there one Sunday, &ldquo;when
there were giants in the land.&rdquo; On the following Monday there was
formerly a large fair, and although Morvah is a very small village
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>without any attractions, the farmers flocked to it
in great numbers to drink and feast, sitting on the hedges of the small
fields common in West Cornwall. &ldquo;Three on one horse, like going
to Morvah Fair,&rdquo; is an old proverb.</p>
<p>On August 5th a large cattle-fair is held in the village of
Goldsithney, in the parish of Perran-Uthnoe. Lysons, in 1814,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;There is a tradition that this fair was originally
held in Sithney, near Helston, and that some persons ran off with the
glove, by the suspension of which to a pole the charter was held, and
carried it off to this village, where, it is said, the glove was hung
out for many years at the time of the fair. As some confirmation of the
tradition of its removal it should be mentioned that the lord of the
manor, a proprietor of the fair, used to pay an acknowledgment of one
shilling per annum to the churchwardens of Sithney.&rdquo; The same
author makes the statement that Truro fair, on November 19th, belongs
to the proprietors of Truro Manor, as high lords of the town, and that
a glove is hung out at this fair as at Chester; he also says that these
same lords claim a tax called smoke-money from most of the houses in
the borough.</p>
<p>In Cornwall the last sheaf of corn cut at harvest-time is &ldquo;the
neck.&rdquo; This in the West is always cut by the oldest reaper, who
shouts out, &ldquo;I hav&rsquo;et! I hav&rsquo;et! I
hav&rsquo;et!&rdquo; The others answer, &ldquo;What hav&rsquo;ee? What
hav&rsquo;ee? What hav&rsquo;ee?&rdquo; He replies, &ldquo;A neck! A
neck! A neck!&rdquo; Then altogether they give three loud hurrahs. The
neck is afterwards made into a miniature sheaf, gaily decorated with
ribbons and flowers; it is carried home in triumph, and hung up to a
beam in the kitchen, where it is left until the next harvest. Mr.
Robert Hunt says that &ldquo;after the neck has been cried three times
they (the reapers) change their cry to &lsquo;we yen! we yen!&rsquo;
which they sound in the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with
singular harmony and effect three times.&rdquo; After this they all
burst out into a kind of loud, joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and
caps into the air, capering about, and perhaps kissing the girls. One
of them gets the &ldquo;neck,&rdquo; and runs as hard as he can to the
farm-house, where the dairy-maid or one of the young female domestics
stands at the door prepared with a pail of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>water.
If he who holds the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; can manage to get into the house
in any way unseen, or openly by any other way than the door by which
the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her;
but if otherwise he is regularly soused with the contents of the
bucket.</p>
<p>The object of crying the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; is to give notice to the
surrounding country of the end of the harvest, and the meaning of
&ldquo;we yen&rdquo; is <i>we have ended</i>.</p>
<p>The last sheaf of the barley-harvest (there is now but little grown)
was the &ldquo;crow-sheaf,&rdquo; and when cut the same ceremony was
gone through; but instead of &ldquo;a neck,&rdquo; the words &ldquo;a
crow&rdquo; were substituted.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;the neck&rdquo; is cut at the house of a squire, the
reapers sometimes assemble at the front of the mansion and cry
&ldquo;the neck,&rdquo; with the addition of these words, &ldquo;and
for our pains we do deserve a glass of brandy, strong beer, and a
bun.&rdquo;&mdash;(John Hills, Penryn, <i><abbr title=
"Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, October, 1882.)</p>
<p>In East Cornwall &ldquo;the neck,&rdquo; which is made into a
slightly different shape, is carried to the mowhay (pronounced mo-ey)
before it is cried (a mowhay is an inclosure for ricks of corn and
hay). One of the men then retires to a distance from the others and
shouts the same formula. It is hung up in the kitchen until
Christmas-day, when it is given to the best ox in the stalls.</p>
<p>The harvest-home feast in the neighbourhood of Penzance goes by the
name of &ldquo;gool-dize,&rdquo; or &ldquo;gool-an-dize.&rdquo; In
Scilly it is known as the &ldquo;nickly thize.&rdquo; Farmers there at
that season of the year formerly killed a sheep, and as long as any
portion of it was left the feast went on.</p>
<p>Ricks of corn in Cornwall are often made, and left to stand in the
&ldquo;arish-fields&rdquo; (stubble-fields) where they were cut. These
are all called &ldquo;arish-mows,&rdquo; but from their different
shapes they have also the names of &ldquo;brummal-mows&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pedrack-mows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probus and Grace fair is held on the 17th of September, through a
charter granted by Charles II. after his restoration, to a Mr. Williams
of that neighbourhood, with whom he had lived for some time during the
Civil Wars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>Probus is in East Cornwall, and its church is famed for its
beautiful tower. Tradition has it that this church was built by Saint
Probus, but for want of funds he could not add the tower, and in his
need asked <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Grace to help him.</p>
<p>She consented, but when the church was consecrated Probus praised
himself, but made no mention of her. Then a mysterious voice was heard,
repeating the following distich:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Probus and
Grace,</p>
<p class="line">Not the first but the la-ast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This town, consequently, has two patron saints.</p>
<p>I know of no other feasten ceremonies in this month; but here, as
elsewhere, the children of the poor make up parties &ldquo;to go a
blackberrying.&rdquo; This fruit, by old people, was said not to be
good after Michaelmas, kept by them 10th October (old style); after
that date they told you the devil spat on them, and birds fouled
them.</p>
<p>I knew an old lady whose birthday falling on that day she
religiously kept it by eating for the last time that year
blackberry-tart with clotted cream.</p>
<p>This brings me round to the month from which I started. Many of the
feasts are of course omitted, as no local customs are now connected
with them. There must be one for nearly every Sunday in the year, and a
mere record of their names would be most wearisome. I cannot do better,
therefore, than finish this portion of my work with two quotations. The
first, from &ldquo;Parochalia,&rdquo; by Mr. T. Q. Couch, <i>Journal
Royal Institute of Cornwall</i>, 1865, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patron saint of Lanivet feast is not known; it is marked
by no particular customs, but is a time for general visiting and
merry-making, with an occasional wrestling-match. A local verse
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;On the nearest Sunday to the last Sunday in
A-prel,</p>
<p class="line xd25e1023">Lanivet men fare well.</p>
<p class="line">On the first Sunday after the first Tuesday in May,</p>
<p class="line xd25e1023">Lanivrey men fare as well as they.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In some parishes the fatted oxen intended to be eaten
at these feasts were, the day before they were killed, led through the
streets, garlanded with flowers and preceded by music. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>Quotation number two is what Carew wrote in 1569:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="en">The saints&rsquo; feast is kept upon
dedication-day by every householder of the parish within his own doors,
each entertayning such forrayne acquaintance as will not fayle when
their like time cometh about to requite him with the like
kindness.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks, and the jingling couplets, could be equally well
applied to all the unmentioned feasts.</p>

<p class="xd25e179"><span class="xd25e179init">C</span>ornish people
possess in a marked degree all the characteristics of the Celts. They
are imaginative, good speakers and story-tellers, describing persons
and things in a style racy and idiomatical, often with appropriate
gestures. Their proverbs are quaint and forcible, they are never at a
lack for an excuse, and are withal very superstitious. Well-educated
people are still to be met with in Cornwall who are firm believers in
apparitions, pixies (fairies, called by the peasantry pisgies), omens,
and other supernatural agencies. Almost every parish has a legend in
connection with its patron saint, and haunted houses abound; but of the
ghosts who inhabit them, unless they differ from those seen elsewhere,
I shall say but little.</p>
<p>This county was once the fabled home of a race of giants, who in
their playful or angry moments were wont to hurl immense rocks at each
other, which are shown by the guides at this day as proofs of their
great strength. To illustrate how in the course of time truth and
fiction get strangely mingled, I will mention the fact that old John of
Gaunt is said to have been the last of these giants, and to have lived
in a castle on the top of Carn Brea (a high hill near Redruth). He
could stride from thence to another neighbouring town, a distance of
four miles. I do not know if he is supposed to be the one that lies
buried under this mighty carn, and whose large protruding hand and bony
fingers time has turned to stone. Here, too, in the dark ages, a
terrific combat took place between Lucifer and a heavenly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>host,
which ended in the former&rsquo;s overthrow. A small monument has been
erected on Carn Brea, to the memory of Lord de Dunstanville; and I once
heard an old woman, after cleaning a room, say, &ldquo;It was fine
enough for Lord de Dunstanville.&rdquo; Every child has heard of Jack
the Giant Killer, who, amongst his other exploits, killed by stratagem
the one who dwelt at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s
Mount:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I am the valiant Cornishman</p>

<p class="first">He did not however confine himself to this
neighbourhood, for of an ancient earth-work near Looe, known as the
&ldquo;Giant&rsquo;s Hedge,&rdquo; it is said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;Jack the giant had nothing to do,</p>
<p class="line">So he made a hedge from Lerrin to Looe.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the sayings and doings of these mighty men have
been told far better than I could tell them in Mr. Halliwell
Phillipps&rsquo; book, <i>Rambles in West Cornwall by the Footsteps of
the Giants</i>; Mr. Robert Hunt&rsquo;s <i>Drolls, Traditions, and
Superstitions of West Cornwall</i>; Mr. Bottrell&rsquo;s <i>Hearthside
Stories of West Cornwall</i>; and by many other writers.</p>
<p>Tourists visit West Cornwall to see the Land&rsquo;s End and its
fine coast scenery, and express themselves disappointed that none of
the country people in that district know anything of King Arthur. They
forget that Uther&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1744src" href=
"#xd25e1744" name="xd25e1744src">1</a> heir was washed up to
Merlin&rsquo;s feet by a wave at the base of &ldquo;Tintagel Castle by
the Cornish sea,&rdquo; which is in the eastern part of the county.
This castle was built on one of the grandest headlands in Cornwall
(slate formation).</p>
<p>The ruins of King Arthur&rsquo;s Castle are most striking. They are
situated partly on the mainland and partly on a peninsula, separated by
a ravine, once said to have been spanned by a drawbridge connecting the
two.</p>
<p>The ascent of this promontory, owing to the slippery nature of the
path cut in the friable slate, is far from pleasant; and, as there was
a stiff breeze blowing when I mounted it, I thought old Norden was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>right when he said: &ldquo;Those should have eyes
who would scale Tintagel.&rdquo; You are, however, amply repaid for
your trouble when you get to the top.</p>
<p>In addition to telling you of the grandeur of the castle in good
King Arthur&rsquo;s days, the guides show you some rock basins to which
they have given the absurd names of &ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s cups and
saucers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tradition assigns to this king another Cornish castle as a
hunting-seat, viz.&mdash;the old earth-round of Castle-an-dinas, near
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb, from whence it is said he chased
the wild deer on Tregoss Downs.</p>
<p>A dreary drive through slate-quarries takes you from Tintagel to
Camelford. Near that town is Slaughter Bridge, the scene of a great
battle between King Arthur and his nephew Modred, whom by some writers
he is said to have killed on the spot; others have it that Arthur died
here of a wound from a poisoned arrow shot by Modred, and that, after
receiving his death wound at Camelford, he was conveyed to Tintagel
Castle, where, surrounded by his knights, he died. All the time he lay
a-dying supernatural noises were heard in the castle, the sea and winds
moaned, and their lamentations never ceased until our hero was buried
at Glastonbury. Then, in the pauses of the solemn tolling of the
funeral bells, sweet voices came from fairy-land welcoming him there,
from whence one day he will return and again be king of Cornwall. No
luck follows a man who kills a Cornish chough (a red legged crow), as,
after his death, King Arthur was changed into one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn, in
East Cornwall, and on the high road from Bodmin to Camelford, is a
group of houses (one of them yet a smith&rsquo;s shop), known by the
name of Longstone. The legend which follows gives the reason of the
name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In lack of records I may say: &lsquo;In the days of King
Arthur there lived in Cornwall a smith. This smith was a keen fellow,
who made and mended the ploughs and harrows, shod the horses of his
neighbours, and was generally serviceable. He had great skill in
farriery, and in the general management of sick cattle. He could also
extract the stubbornest tooth, even if the jaw resisted, and some
gyrations around the anvil were required. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;There seems ever to have been ill blood between
devil and smith, and so it was between the fiend and the
smith-farrier-dentist of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn. At night
there were many and fierce disputes between them in the smithy. The
smith, as the rustics tell, always got the advantage of his adversary,
and gave him better than he brought. This success, however, only
fretted Old Nick, and spurred him on to further encounters. What the
exact matter of controversy on this particular occasion was is not
remembered, but it was agreed to settle it by some wager, some trial of
strength and skill. A two-acred field was near; and the smith
challenged the devil to the reaping of each his acre in the shortest
time. The match came off, and the devil was beaten, for the smith had
beforehand stealthily stuck here and there over his opponent&rsquo;s
acre some harrow-tines or teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The two started well, but soon the strong swing
of the fiend&rsquo;s scythe was brought up frequently by some
obstruction, and as frequently he required the whetstone. The dexterous
and agile smith went on smoothly with his acre, and was soon
unmistakeably gaining. The devil, enraged at his certain discomfiture,
hurled his whetstone at his rival, and flew off. The whetstone, thrown
with great violence, after sundry whirls in the air, fell upright into
the soil at a great depth, and there remained a witness against the
Evil One for ages. The devil avoided the neighbourhood whilst it stood,
but in an evil hour the farmer at Treblethick, near, threw it down.
That night the enemy returned, and has haunted the neighbourhood ever
since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;This monolith was of granite, and consequently
brought hither from a distance, for the local stone is a friable slate.
It yielded four large gate-posts, gave spans to a small bridge, and
left much granite remaining.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;&mdash;T. Q. Couch,
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, April, 1883.</p>
<p>Upon <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell Down is an upright block
of granite, called &ldquo;the giant&rsquo;s staff, or longstone,&rdquo;
to which this legend is attached:&mdash;&ldquo;A giant, travelling one
night over these hills, was overtaken by a storm, which blew off his
hat. He immediately pursued it; but, being impeded by a staff which he
carried in his hand, he thrust this into the ground until his hat could
be secured. After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>wandering, however, for some time in the
dark, without being able to find his hat, he gave over the pursuit and
returned for the staff; but this also he was unable to discover, and
both were irrevocably lost. In the morning, when the giant was gone,
his hat and staff were both found by the country people about a mile
asunder. The hat was found on White-horse Down, and bore some
resemblance to a mill-stone, and continued in its place until 1798,
when, some soldiers having encamped around it, they fancied, it is
said, as it was a wet season, this giant&rsquo;s hat was the cause of
the rain, and therefore rolled it over the cliff. The staff, or
longstone, was discovered in the position in which it remains; it is
about twelve feet high, and tapering toward the top, and is said to
have been so fashioned by the giant that he might grasp it with
ease.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Murray&rsquo;s Guide.</i></p>
<p>There is another longstone in the parish of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1798src" href=
"#xd25e1798" name="xd25e1798src">2</a> about two miles north of
Liskeard, which bears an inscription to Doniert (Dungerth), a
traditional king of Cornwall, who was drowned in 872. In fact, these
&ldquo;menhirs,&rdquo; supposed to be sepulchral monuments, are to be
found scattered all over the county.</p>
<p>The following curious bit of folk-lore appeared in the <i>Daily
News</i> of March 8th, 1883, communicated by the <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. Hoskyns Abrahall, Coombe Vicarage, near
Woodstock:&mdash;&ldquo;A friend of mine, who is vicar of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer, in East Cornwall, has told me that at least
one housemaid of his&mdash;I think his servants in general&mdash;very
anxiously avoided killing a spider, because Parson Jupp, my
friend&rsquo;s predecessor (whom he succeeded in 1844), was, it was
believed, somewhere in the vicarage in some spider&mdash;no one knew in
which of the vicarage spiders.&rdquo; Spiders are often not destroyed
because of the tradition that one spun a web over Christ in the manger,
and hid him from Herod.</p>
<p>There are other superstitions current in Cornwall somewhat similar
to the above. Maidens who die of broken hearts, after they have been
deceived by unfaithful lovers, are said to haunt their betrayers as
white hares. The souls of old sea-captains never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>sleep;
they are turned into gulls and albatrosses. The knockers (a tribe of
little people), who live underground in the tin-mines, are the spirits
of the Jews who crucified our Saviour, and are for that sin compelled
on Christmas morning to sing carols in his honour. &ldquo;Jew&rdquo; is
a name also given to a black field-beetle (why, I know not). It exudes
a reddish froth: country children hold it on their hands and say,
&ldquo;Jew! Jew! spit blood!&rdquo; &ldquo;A ghost at Pengelly, in the
parish of Wendron, was compelled by a parson of that village after
various changes of form to seek refuge in a pigeonhole, where it is
confined to this day.&rdquo;&mdash;Through <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle.</p>
<p>After this digression I will return to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer, and, beginning with its holy well, briefly
notice a few others. It is situated not far from the church, and was
once celebrated as a &ldquo;boussening,&rdquo; or ducking-well for the
cure of mad people. Considerable remains of the baptistery, which
formerly enclosed it, are still standing, and outside, close by, is an
old stone cross. Carew says,&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="en">There were
many bowssening places in Cornwall for curing mad people, and amongst
the rest one at Alter Nunne, in the hundred of Trigges, called S.
Nunne&rsquo;s well, and because the manner of this bowssening is not so
vnpleasing to heare as it was vneasie to feele, I wil (if you please)
deliuer you the practise, as I receyued it from the beholders. The
water running from S. Nunne&rsquo;s well fell into a square and
close-walled plot, which might be filled at what depth they listed.
Vpon this wall was the franticke person set to stand, his backe toward
the poole, and from thence with a sudden blow in the brest, tumbled
headlong into the pond, where a strong fellowe, provided for the nonce,
tooke him and tossed him vp and downe, alongst and athwart the water,
vntill the patient by foregoing his strength had somewhat forgot his
fury. Then was hee conueyed to the church and certain Masses sung ouer
him; vpon which handling if his wits returned S. Nunne had the thanks:
but if there appeared small amendment, he was bowssened againe and
againe, while there remayned in him any hope of life for
recouery.</span>&rdquo; The same writer says of Scarlet&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<span lang="en">well neare vnto Bodmin, howbeit the water should
seem to be healthfull, if not helpfull: for it retaineth this
extraordinary quality, that the same is waightier than the ordinary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>of his kind, and will continue the best part of a
yeere without alteration or sent or taste, only you shall see it
represent many colours, like the Rain-bowe which (in my conceite)
argueth a running throu some minerall veine and therewithall a
possessing of some vertue.</span>&rdquo; I must give one more quotation
from Carew before I finish with him, about a well at
Saltash:&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="en">I had almost forgotten to tell
you that there is a well in this towne whose water will not boyle
peason to a seasonable softnes.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The holy wells in Cornwall are very numerous; the greater part were
in olden times enclosed in small baptisteries. Luckily the poor people
believe that to remove any of the stones of the ruins of these chapels
would be fatal to them and to their children, and for that reason a
great number yet remain. It is considered unlucky, too, to cart away
any of the druidical monuments (&ldquo;pieces of ancientcy&rdquo;), and
many are the stories told of the great misfortunes that have fallen on
men who have so done. The innocent oxen or horses who drag them away
are always sure to die, and their master never prosper. Persistent
ill-luck also follows any one defiling these wells; and a tradition is
current in one of the &ldquo;West Country&rdquo; parishes, of a
gentleman, who, after he had washed his dogs, afflicted with the mange,
in its holy well, fell into such poverty that his sons were obliged to
work as day labourers. Mr. T. Q. Couch, in <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
vol. x., gives this legend in connection with <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Nunn&rsquo;s well in Pelynt:&mdash;&ldquo;An old
farmer once set his eyes upon the granite basin and coveted it; for it
was not wrong in his eyes to convert the holy font to the base uses of
the pig&rsquo;s stye; and accordingly he drove his oxen and wain to the
gateway above for the purpose of removing it. Taking his beasts to the
entrance of the well, he essayed to drag the trough from its ancient
bed. For a long time it resisted the efforts of the oxen, but at length
they succeeded in starting it, and dragged it slowly up the hill-side
to where the wain was standing. Here, however, it burst away from the
chains which held it, and, rolling back again to the well, made a sharp
turn and regained its old position, where it has remained ever since.
Nor will any one again attempt its removal, seeing that the farmer, who
was previously well-to-do in the world, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>never prospered from that
day forward. Some people say, indeed, that retribution overtook him on
the spot, the oxen falling dead, and the owner being struck lame and
speechless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nunn&rsquo;s well is not the
&ldquo;boussening&rdquo; well formerly mentioned, but another dedicated
to the same saint, and is resorted to as a divining and wishing well;
it is commonly called by the people of that district the
&ldquo;Piskies&rsquo; well.&rdquo; Pins are thrown into it, not only to
see by the bubbles which rise on the water whether the wisher will get
what he desires, but also to propitiate the piskies and to bring the
thrower good luck. This county has many other divining wells which were
visited at certain seasons of the year by those anxious to know what
the future would bring them. Amongst them the Lady of Nant&rsquo;s
well, in the parish of Colan, was formerly much frequented on Palm
Sunday, when those who wished to foretell their fate threw into the
water crosses made of palms. There was once in Gulval parish, near
Penzance, a well which was reported to have had great repute as a
divining well. People repaired to it to ask if their friends at a
distance were well or ill, living or dead. They looked into the water
and repeated the words:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Water, water, tell me truly,</p>
<p class="line">Is the man that I love duly</p>
<p class="line">On the earth, or under the sod,</p>
<p class="line">Sick or well? in the name of God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Should the water bubble up quite clear, the one asked
for was in good health; if it became puddled, ill; and should it remain
still, dead. Of the wells of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Roche,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maddern (now Madron), and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Uny, I have spoken in the first part of this
work.</p>
<p>The waters from several wells are used for baptismal rites (one near
Laneast is called the &ldquo;Jordan&rdquo;), and the children baptized
with water from the wells of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Euny (at
the foot of Carn Brea, Redruth) and of Ludgvan (Penzance), &amp;c., it
was asserted could never be hanged with a hempen rope; but this
prophecy has unfortunately been proved to be false. The water from the
latter was famed too as an eye-wash, until an evil spirit, banished for
his misdeeds by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ludgvan, to the Red Sea,
spat into it from malice as he passed. The Red Sea is the favourite
traditional spot here for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>the banishment of wicked spirits, and
I have been told stories of wicked men whose souls, immediately after
their death, were carried off to well-known volcanoes.</p>
<p>Almost all these holy wells were once noted for the curing of
diseases, but the water from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Jesus&rsquo; well, in Miniver, was especially famed for curing
whooping-cough. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin&rsquo;s well, in
the centre of Liskeard at the back of the market, known as &ldquo;Pipe
Well,&rdquo; from the four iron pipes through which four springs run
into it, was formerly not only visited for the healing qualities of its
chief spring, but for a lucky stone that stood in it. By standing on
this stone and drinking of the well&rsquo;s water, engaged couples
would be happy and successful in their married life. It also conferred
magical powers on any person who touched it. The stone is still there,
but has now been covered over and has lost its virtue.</p>
<p>The saints sometimes lived by the side of the holy wells named after
them, notably <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes (pronounced

Keyne&rsquo;s, more widely known outside Cornwall through
Southey&rsquo;s ballad than any of the others. It is situated in a
small valley in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, and
was in the days of Carew and Norden arched over by four trees, which
grew so closely together that they seemed but one trunk. Both writers
say the trees were withy, oak, elm, and ash (by withy I suppose willow
was meant). They were all blown down by a storm, and about 150 years
ago, Mr. Rashleigh, of Menabilly, replaced them with two oaks, two
elms, and one ash. I do not know if they are living, but Mr. J. T.
Blight in 1858, in his book on <i>Cornish Crosses</i>, speaks of one of
the oaks being at that time so decayed that it had to be propped. The
reputed virtue of the water of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Keyne&rsquo;s well is, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"

Michael&rsquo;s Mount she gave the same virtue to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s chair. This chair is the remains of
an old lantern on the south-west angle of the tower, at a height of
upwards of 250 feet from low water. It is fabled to have been a
favourite seat of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s.
Whittaker, in his supplement to Polwhele&rsquo;s <i>History of
Cornwall</i>, says, &ldquo;It was for such pilgrims as had stronger
heads and bolder spirits to complete their devotions at the Mount by
sitting in this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s chair
and <i>showing themselves as pilgrims to the country round</i>;&rdquo;
but it most probably served as a beacon for ships at sea. To get into
it you must climb on to the parapet, and you sit with your feet
dangling over a sheer descent of at least seventy feet; but to get out
of it is much more difficult, as the sitter is obliged to turn round in
the seat. Notwithstanding this, and the danger of a fall through
giddiness, which, of course, would be certain death, for there is not
the slightest protection, I have seen ladies perform the feat.
Curiously enough Southey has also written a ballad on <abbr title=

<p class="first">Old writers give the name of &ldquo;Caraclowse in
clowse&rdquo; to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s Mount,
which means the Hoar Rock in the Wood; and that it was at one time
surrounded by trees is almost certain, as at very low tides in
Mount&rsquo;s Bay a &ldquo;submarine forest,&rdquo; with roots of large
trees, may still be clearly seen. At these seasons branches of trees,
with leaves, nuts, and beetles, have been picked up.</p>
<p>Old folks often compared an old-fashioned child to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s Mount, and quaintly said,
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s a regular little Mount, <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s Mount will never be washed away
while she&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Folk-lore speaks of a time when Scilly was joined to the mainland,
which does not seem very improbable when we remember that within the
last twenty-five years a high road and a field have been washed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>away by the sea between Newlyn and Penzance. An
old lady, whose memory went back to the beginning of the present
century, told me that she had often seen boys playing at cricket in
some fields seaward of Newlyn, of which no vestige in my time
remained.</p>
<p>But the Lyonnesse, as this tract of land (containing 140 parish
churches) between the Land&rsquo;s End and Scilly was called, and
where, according to the Poet Laureate, King Arthur met his
death-wound,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;So all day long the noise of battle

</div>
<p class="first">is reputed to have been suddenly overwhelmed by a
great flood. Only one man of all the dwellers on it is said to have
escaped death, an ancestor of the Trevilians (now Trevelyan). He was
carried on shore by his horse into a cove at Perran. Alarmed by the
daily inroad of the sea, he had previously removed his wife and family.
Old fishermen of a past generation used to declare that on clear days
and moonlight nights they had often seen under the water the roofs of
churches, houses, &amp;c., of this submerged district.</p>
<p>Whether the memory of this flood is perpetuated by the old proverb,
&ldquo;As ancient as the floods of Dava,&rdquo; once commonly current
in West Cornwall, but which I have not heard for years, I know not, as
I have never met with any one who could tell me to what floods it
referred.</p>
<p>Tradition also speaks of a wealthy city in the north of Cornwall,
called Langarrow, which for its wickedness was buried in sand, driven
in by a mighty storm. All that coast as far west as <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives is sand, known as &ldquo;Towans,&rdquo; and the
sand is always encroaching.</p>
<p>There is a little church now near Padstow, dedicated to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Enodock, which is often almost covered by the
shifting drifts. It is in a solitary situation, and service is only
held there once a year, when a path to it has to be cut through the
sand. It is said that the clergyman, in order to keep his emoluments
and fees, has been sometimes obliged to get into it through a window or
hole in the roof. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span></p>
<p>About eight miles from Truro is the lost church of Perranzabuloe,
which for centuries was supposed to have been a myth, but the shifting
of the sand disclosed it in 1835.</p>
<p>In Hayle Towans is buried the castle of Tendar, the Pagan chief who
persecuted the Christians, and in the neighbouring parish of Lelant
that of King Theodrick, who, after beheading, in Ireland, many saints,
crossed over to Cornwall on a millstone.</p>
<p>Many of the Cornish saints are reputed to have come into Cornwall in
the same way as this king; but <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ia, the
patron saint of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, chose a frailer
vessel. She crossed from Ireland on a leaf.</p>
<p>The afore-mentioned lost city was most likely a very small place, as
I asked an old woman three or four years ago, who lived not far from
the little village of Gwithian, where I could get something I wanted,
and she told me, &ldquo;In the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bay between this place and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives
(<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives Bay) has the reputation of being
haunted at stormy times before a shipwreck by a lady in white, who
carries a lantern.</p>
<p>At Nancledra, a village near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives,
was formerly a logan rock, which could only be moved at midnight; and
children were cured of rickets by being placed on it at that hour. It
refused to rock for those who were illegitimate.</p>
<p>Not far from here is Towednack, and there is a legend to the effect
that the devil would never allow the tower of its church to be
completed, pulling down at night what had been built up in the day.
When a person makes an incredible statement he is in West Cornwall told
&ldquo;To go to Towednack quay-head where they christen calves.&rdquo;
(No part of this parish touches the sea.)</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Hunt records a curious test of innocency which, not long
since, was practised in this parish. &ldquo;A farmer in Towednack
having been robbed of some property of no great value was resolved,
nevertheless, to employ a test which he had heard the &lsquo;old
people&rsquo; resorted to for the purpose of catching the thief. He
invited all his neighbours into his cottage, and, when they were
assembled, he placed a cock under the &lsquo;brandice&rsquo; (an iron
vessel, formerly much employed by the peasantry in baking when this
process was carried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>out on the hearth, the fuel being furze and
ferns). Every one was directed to touch the brandice with his, or her,
third finger, and say: &lsquo;In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, speak.&rsquo; Every one did as they were directed, and no sound
came from beneath the brandice. The last person was a woman, who
occasionally laboured for the farmer in his fields. She hung back,
hoping to pass unobserved amongst the crowd. But her very anxiety made
her a suspected person. She was forced forward, and most unwillingly
she touched the brandice, when, before she could utter the words
prescribed, the cock crew. The woman fell faint on the floor, and when
she recovered, she confessed herself to be the thief, restored the
stolen property, and became, it is said, &lsquo;a changed character
from that day.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following was told me by a friend. It took place in a school of
one of our western parishes about sixty years ago:&mdash;&ldquo;It was
in the days of quill pens, and the master had lost his penknife. Every
boy pleaded not guilty. At twelve the master said no boy should leave
the school for half-an-hour, when he would return and see if they had
found his knife. The door was locked, and at the appointed time he came
back with a small, round table, on which he had inverted a
&lsquo;half-strike&rsquo; (4 gallons) measure. The table was placed in
the middle of the gangway; the master stood by the side of it, and
asked if they had found his knife. All said &lsquo;No!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;come out slowly one at a
time and let each touch this measure with the right forefinger, and the
bantam-cock under it will crow at the thief.&rsquo; The boys went out
boldly, as they passed touching the tub, but the master missed one whom
from the first he had suspected. He again locked the door, searched the
rooms, and there, under a desk, not in his own place, he found the boy
hiding. He began to cry, confessed the theft, and gave up the
knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another test of innocency, practised in bygone days, was to kindle a
fire on one of the table-m&ecirc;n (large flat stones), so common in
villages in West Cornwall. A stick lit at this was handed to the
accused, who had to put out the fire by spitting on it. It is
well-known that fear dries up saliva. It is still supposed in remote
districts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>that no one can bear witness to a misdemeanour,
seen through glass.</p>
<p>I will describe another rough ordeal before I go on to the legends
of the Land&rsquo;s End district. It is called &ldquo;Riding the
hatch,&rdquo; or &ldquo;heps&rdquo; (a half-door often seen at small
country shops). Any man formerly accused of immorality was brought
before a select number of his fellow parishioners, and by them put to
sit astride the &ldquo;heps,&rdquo; which was shaken violently
backwards and forwards: if he fell into the house he was judged
innocent; but out on the road, guilty. When any one has been brought
before his superiors and remanded he is still figuratively said
&ldquo;to have been made to ride the &lsquo;heps.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
Hands are washed, as by Pontius Pilate, to clear a person from crime,
and to call any one &ldquo;dirty-fingered&rdquo; is to brand him as a
thief.</p>
<p>On a bench-end in Zennor church there is a very singular carving of
a mermaid. To account for it Zennor folks say that hundreds of years
ago a beautifully-attired lady, who came and went mysteriously, used
occasionally to attend their church and sing so divinely that she
enchanted all who heard her. She came year after year, but never aged
nor lost her good looks. At last one Sunday, by her charms, she enticed
a young man, the best singer in the parish, to follow her: he never
returned, and was heard of no more. A long time after, a vessel lying
in Pendower cove, into which she sailed one Sunday, cast her anchor,
and in some way barred the access to a mermaid&rsquo;s dwelling. She
rose up from the sea, and politely asked the captain to remove it. He
landed at Zennor, and related his adventure, and those who heard it
agreed that this must have been the lady who decoyed away the poor
young man.</p>
<p>Not far from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just is the solitary,
dreary cairn, known as Cairn Kenidzhek (pronounced Kenidjack), which
means the &ldquo;hooting cairn,&rdquo; so called from the unearthly
noises which proceed from it on dark nights. It enjoys a bad reputation
as the haunt of witches. Close under it lies a barren stretch of
moorland, the &ldquo;Gump,&rdquo; over it the devil hunts at night poor
lost souls; he rides on the half-starved horses turned out here to
graze, and is sure to overtake them at a particular stile. It is often
the scene of demon fights, when one holds the lanthorn to give the
others light, and is also a great resort <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>of the pixies. Woe to the
unhappy person who may be there after night-fall: they will lead him
round and round, and he may be hours before he manages to get out of
the place away from his tormentors. Here more than once fortunate
persons have seen &ldquo;the small people&rdquo; too, at their revels,
and their eyes have been dazzled by the sight of their wonderful
jewels; but if they have ever managed to secrete a few, behold next
morning they were nothing but withered leaves, or perhaps
snail-shells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Sennen Cove was much frequented by mermaids.
This place was also resorted to by a remarkable spirit called the
Hooper&mdash;from the hooping, or hooting sounds it was accustomed to
make. In old times, according to tradition, a compact cloud of mist
often came in from over the sea, when the weather was by no means
foggy, and rested on the rocks called Cowloc, thence it spread itself
like a curtain of cloud quite across Sennen Cove. By night a dull light
was mostly seen amidst the vapour, with sparks ascending as if a fire
burned within it: at the same time hooping sounds were heard proceeding
therefrom. People believed the misty cloud shrouded a spirit, which
came to forewarn them of approaching storms, and that those who
attempted to put to sea found an invisible force&mdash;seemingly in the
mist&mdash;to resist them. A reckless fisherman and his son, however,
disregarding the token, launched their boat and beat through the fog
with a &ldquo;threshal&rdquo; (flail); they passed the cloud of mist
which followed them, and neither the men nor the hooper were ever more
seen in Sennen Cove. This is the only place in the county where any
tradition of such a guardian spirit is
preserved.&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same author tells a story of a reputed astrologer called
Dionysius Williams, who lived in Mayon, in Sennen, a century ago. He
found his furze-rick was diminishing faster than it ought, and
discovered by his art that some women in Sennen Cove were in the habit
of taking it away at night. The very next night, when all honest folks
should be in bed, an old woman from the Cove came as was her wont to
his rick for a &ldquo;burn&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2154src"
href="#xd25e2154" name="xd25e2154src">4</a> of furze. She made one of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>no more than the usual size but could not lift it,
neither could she after she had lightened her &ldquo;burn&rdquo; by
half. Frightened, she tried to take out the rope and run away, but she
could neither draw it out nor move herself. Of course Mr. Williams had
put a spell upon her, and there she had to remain in the cold all
night. He came out in the morning and released her, giving her, as she
was poor, the furze. Neither she nor the other women ever troubled him
again.</p>
<p>Before proceeding any further, to make an allusion in the next
legend intelligible, I must say something about Tregeagle (pronounced
Tregaygle), the Cornish Bluebeard, who was popularly supposed to have
sold his soul to the devil, that his wishes might be granted for a
certain number of years; and who, in addition to several other crimes,
is accused of marrying and murdering many rich heiresses to obtain
<span class="corr" id="xd25e2161" title="Source: ther">their</span>
money. One day, just before his death, he was present when one man lent
a large sum to another without receiving receipt or security for it
(the money was borrowed for Tregeagle). Soon after Tregeagle&rsquo;s
death the borrower denied that he had ever had it, and the case was
brought into Bodmin Court to be tried, when the defendant said,
&ldquo;If Tregeagle ever saw it I wish to God that Tregeagle may come
into court and declare it.&rdquo; No sooner were the words spoken than
Tregeagle appeared, and gave his witness in favour of the plaintiff,
declaring &ldquo;that he could not speak falsely; but he who had found
it so easy to raise him would find it difficult to lay him.&rdquo; The
money was paid, but the wretched man was followed night and day by the
spirit, and great labour had the parsons and wise men before they could
finally rid him of his tormentor. There are many versions of this
transaction. Tregeagle himself is said in another to have received the
money for an estate of which he was steward, and not to have entered it
in his books. His ghost was doomed to do many impossible things, such
as to empty Dosmery pool, near Bodmin Moor, with a limpet shell that
had a hole in the bottom. This pool had the reputation, too, of being
bottomless; but it has lately been cut into and drained by the workers
of the granite quarries. Strange tales are told in that neighbourhood
of his appearing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73"
name="pb73">73</a>]</span>people, and of his dismal howls at not being
able to fulfil his tasks. Mothers all over Cornwall when their children
are loudly crying may be often heard to declare &ldquo;that they are
roaring worse than Tregeagle.&rdquo; &ldquo;A tradition of the
neighbourhood says that on the shores of this lonely mere (Dosmery
pool) the ghosts of bad men are ever employed in binding the sand in
bundles with &lsquo;beams&rsquo; (bands) of the same. These ghosts, or
some of them, were driven out (they say horsewhipped out) by the parson
from Launceston.&rdquo;&mdash;<abbr>H. G. T.</abbr> <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, December, 1850.</p>
<p>Tregeagle had also to remove the sand from one cove to another,
where the sea always returned it. It was on one of these expeditions
that either by accident or design he dropped a sackful at the mouth of
Loe-pool, near Helston. (When in wet seasons the waters of this pool
rise to such a height as to obstruct the working of the mills on its
banks, and heavy seas have silted up the sand at its mouth, the Mayor
of Helston presents by ancient custom two leather purses containing
three halfpence each as his dues to the lord of Penrose who owns
Loe-pool, and asks for permission to cut a passage through the bar to
the sea). Another of Tregeagle&rsquo;s tasks is to make and carry away
a truss of sand bound with a rope of sand from Gwenvor (the cove at
Whitsand Bay) near the Land&rsquo;s End. But his unquiet spirit finds
no rest, for whilst he is trying to do his never-ending work the devil
hunts him from place to place, until he hides for refuge in a
hermit&rsquo;s ruined chapel on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Roche&rsquo;s rocks (East Cornwall).</p>
<p>When the sea roars before a storm, people in the Land&rsquo;s End
district say &ldquo;Tregeagle is calling,&rdquo; and often, too, his
voice may be heard lamenting around Loe-pool.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The substance of the following I had from a Penzance man (H. R. C.),
to whom I must own I am indebted for much information about Cornish
folk-lore. All his life he has in his business mingled with the
peasantry of West Cornwall, and, unlike myself, he comes from a long
line of Cornishmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Gwenvor Sands, in Whitsand Bay, at the Land&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>End, and have heard of the unresting spirit of
Tregeagle, by whom that spot is haunted. He foretells storms, and calls
before the wind reaches home. I have often heard him howling before a
westerly hurricane in the still of midnight at my house in Penzance, a
distance of ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tradition tells that on these sands, many centuries ago, some
foreigners landed, and fought a great battle with the inhabitants,
under King Arthur, on Vellan-drucher Moor. &ldquo;Where Madron, Gulval,
and Zennor meet, there is a flat stone where Prince Arthur and four
British kings dined, and the four kings collected the native Cornish
who fought under them at the battle of
Vellan-drucher.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bottrell.) This was long before the
Spaniards (pronounced Spanyers) in 1595 came ashore at the same place
from a galley &ldquo;high by day&rdquo; (in broad daylight), and burnt
Vellan-dreath, a mill close by.</p>
<p>These foreigners are popularly supposed to be red-haired Danes, and
they stayed so long &ldquo;that the birds built in the rigging of their
ships.&rdquo; In all the western parishes of Cornwall there has existed
time out of mind a great antipathy to certain red-haired families, who
are said to be their descendants, and, much to their disgust, they are
often hailed as Danes (pronounced Deanes). Indeed this dislike was
carried so far that few would allow any members of their families to
intermarry with them. In addition to the usual country gossip in the
beginning of this century amongst the women of this district whilst
knitting at their doors (for the Cornish are famous
&ldquo;knitsters&rdquo;), or sitting round &ldquo;breeding&rdquo;
(netting) fishing-nets, they had one never-failing topic of
conversation in their fears that the foreigners would land once more on
Gwenvor Sands, or at Priest&rsquo;s Cove,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2195src" href="#xd25e2195" name="xd25e2195src">6</a> in Pendeen,
near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just. Who these strangers were to
be they were not at all sure, but they knew that the red-haired Danes
were to come again, when Vellan-drucher (a water mill-wheel) would once
more be worked with blood, and the kings for the last time would dine
around the Garrick Zans (Table M&ecirc;n); and the end of the world
would come soon after: for had not Merlin so prophesied more than a
thousand years ago? Garrick Zans is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75"
href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>the old name for a large flat
stone, the Table M&ecirc;n (pronounced Mayon), at Sennen, near the
Land&rsquo;s End, and seven mythical Saxon kings are said to have dined
at it when on a visit to Cornwall, <abbr>A.D.</abbr> 600. &ldquo;Around
it old folk went nine times daily, from some notion that is was lucky
and good against witchcraft.&rdquo;&mdash;(Bottrell.)</p>
<p>Off the Land&rsquo;s End is a very striking rock rising out of the
sea. It is known as the Irish Lady, from the fact that an Irish vessel
was once wrecked on it, and out of all on board one poor lady alone
managed to scramble up to the top; but no boat could get to her, and,
exhausted by fatigue, she fell into the water, and was drowned. Her
spirit still haunts the spot. This is most probably a fanciful tale, as
the rock bears some resemblance to a human figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During a dreadful thunderstorm and hurricane on the 30th
January, 1648, the day on which King Charles was beheaded, a large
stone figure of a man, called the &lsquo;Armed Knight,&rsquo; which
stood in an upright position at the extremity of the Land&rsquo;s End,
forty fathoms above the level of the sea, was thrown down. On the same
day a ship riding in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives Bay, having on
board the king&rsquo;s wardrobe and other furniture belonging to the
royal family, bound for France, broke from her moorings, and ran ashore
on the rocks of Godrevy Island, where all on board, about sixty
persons, were drowned, except one man and a boy.&rdquo;&mdash;G. S.
Gilbert&rsquo;s <i>Cornwall</i>.</p>
<p>The name of Armed Knight has been transferred to another pile of
rocks off the Land&rsquo;s End. The &ldquo;stone figure&rdquo; thrown
down was most probably a natural formation, as one of the rocks there
now bears the fanciful name of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s Head, from a
supposed likeness. Other versions of this legend say &ldquo;that the
Armed Knight was only ninety feet high, with an iron spire on its
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porthgwarra in olden times was known as Sweethearts&rsquo; Cove from
the following circumstance: The daughter of a well-to-do farmer loved a
sailor, who was once one of her father&rsquo;s serving-men. Her
parents, especially her mother, disapproved of the match; and when the
young man returned from sea and came to see his sweetheart, he was
forbidden the house. The lovers however met, and vowed to be true to
each other, Nancy saying, &ldquo;That she would never marry any other
man,&rdquo; and William, &ldquo;That, dead or alive, he would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>one day claim her as his bride.&rdquo; He again
went to sea, and for a long time no tidings came, neither from nor of
him. Poor Nancy grew melancholy, and spent all her days, and sometimes
nights, looking out seaward from a spot on the cliff, called then
Nancy&rsquo;s Garden, now Hella Point. She gradually became quite mad;
and one night fancied she heard her lover tapping at her bed-room
window, and calling her to come out to him, saying: &ldquo;Sleepest
thou, sweetheart? Awaken, and come hither, love. My boat awaits us at
the cove. Thou must come this night, or never be my bride.&rdquo; She
dressed, went to the cove, and was never seen again. Tradition says
that the same night William appeared to his father, told him that he
had come for his bride, and bade him farewell; and that next day the
news arrived of his having been drowned at sea. Bottrell gives this
legend under the title of &ldquo;The Tragedy of Sweet William and Fair
Nancy.<span class="corr" id="xd25e2223" title=

<p>Not far from the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan is a
small piece of ground&mdash;&ldquo;Johanna&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; which
is fuller of weeds than of flowers. The owner of it was one Sunday
morning in her garden gathering greens for her dinner, when she saw
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan going by to catch some fish for
his. He stopped and greeted her, upon which she reproved him for
fishing on a Sunday, and asked him what he thought would be his end if
he did so. He tried to convince her that it was not worse than picking
greens, but she would not listen to reason. At last <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Levan lost patience, and said, &ldquo;From this time
for ever thou shalt be known, if known at all, as the Foolish Johanna,
and thy garden shall ever continue to bear, as now, more hemlocks and
nettles than leeks and lentils. Mark this! to make thy remembrance the
more accursed for all time to come, if any child of thy name be
baptised in the waters of Parchapel-well (close at hand) it shall
become a fool, like thyself, and bad luck follow
it.&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
<p>There is a cleft-stone in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan
churchyard called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan&rsquo;s stone;
but it is said to have been venerated in the days of King Arthur; and
Merlin, who once visited these parts with him, uttered this prophecy
concerning it:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When, with panniers astride,</p>
<p class="line">A pack-horse can ride</p>

<p>Unless some earthquake splits it further the world will last

<p>On an almost inaccessible granite peak seaward of the pile of rocks
known as Castle Treryn (pronounced Treen), once the haunt and
meeting-place of witches, on the summit of which is perched the
far-famed Cornish logan-rock, is a sharp peak with a hole in it, large
enough to insert a hand. At the bottom lay an egg-shaped stone,
traditionally called the key of the castle, which, although easily
shifted, had for ages defied all attempts at removal. It was said that
should any one ever succeed in getting it out, Castle Treryn&mdash;in
fact the whole cairn&mdash;would immediately disappear. It was
unfortunately knocked out by the men who replaced the logan-rock,
thrown down by Lieutenant Goldsmith. Its position was often altered by
heavy seas, and from it the old folk formerly foretold the weather.</p>
<p>In Buryan parish, named after an Irish saint, a king&rsquo;s
daughter, who came into Cornwall with some of her companions in the
fifth century, is the famous circle of Dawns Myin, or the Merry
Maidens, originally consisting of nineteen upright stones. They are
nineteen maidens, who for their sin of dancing on a Sunday were all
turned into stone. Two m&ecirc;nhirs in a neighbouring field are the
pipers, who at the same time suffered the same fate. Of these and other
stone circles an old writer says, &ldquo;No man when counting them can
bring the stones twice the same number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not far from Buryan, between Sennen and Penzance, is a very solitary
weird spot&mdash;a disused Quakers&rsquo; burial-ground. In its lonely
neighbourhood is sometimes seen by a privileged few, &ldquo;high by
day,&rdquo; the spirit of a huntsman, followed by his dogs. He is
dressed in the hunting costume of bygone ages; he suddenly appears (for
neither his horse&rsquo;s hoofs nor his dogs&rsquo; feet make any
sound), jumps over an adjacent hedge, and is as suddenly lost to view.
I do not know if tradition has ever connected this huntsman with Wild
Harris of Kenegie,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2266src" href=
"#xd25e2266" name="xd25e2266src">7</a> who was killed when hunting by a
fall from his horse&mdash;it was frightened by a white hare, the spirit
of a deserted maiden, which crossed its path. His ghost, in his
hunting-dress, appeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>standing at the door of his house the
night he was buried&mdash;the funeral, according to an old custom, had
taken place at midnight. For years after he might be met in the
vicinity of his home, and he and his boon companions were often heard
carousing at nights in a summer-house on the bowling-green. Few then
cared to pass Kenegie after dark, for his was said not to be the only
spirit that haunted the place. Wild Harris&rsquo;s ghost was finally
laid to rest by a famous ghost-laying parson, and put as a task to
count the blades of grass nine times in an enclosure on the top of
Castle-an-Dinas, an old earth fortification near where he is said to
have met his death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2271src" href=
"#xd25e2271" name="xd25e2271src">8</a> Ghosts only &ldquo;walk&rdquo;
(appear) in the parish where their bodies were buried.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of Buryan to the Quakers&rsquo; burial-ground
is the parish of Paul (<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pol-de-Leon). Its
church was burnt by the Spaniards in 1595. They landed on a rock, said
to have been named after Merlin&mdash;Merlin&rsquo;s car, and marched
from Paul to Penzance, which they also fired in several places. I am
afraid the inhabitants did not make a very bold stand against them; for
Merlin had prophesied centuries before&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That they should land on the rock of Merlin,</p>
<p class="line">Who would burn Paul, Penzance, and Newlyn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And this caused them to lose courage, and falsify the
old proverb:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Car and Pen, Pol and Tre,</p>
<p class="line">Would make the devil run away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Close by the highway, where the Buryan road joins the
high-road from Paul to Penzance, is a smoothly-cut, conical granite
stone, popularly supposed to have been placed there in memory of some
woman who was found murdered at that spot, with nothing on to identify
her, and with only a thimble and ring in her pocket. It really marks
the place where an ancient gold ring, three inches and a half in
diameter, bearing the motto, &ldquo;In hac spe vivo,&rdquo; was
discovered in 1781. In the same parish, a short walk from this place,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>are some Druidical remains, which have the curious
name of &ldquo;Kerris roundago.&rdquo; Some stones taken from it to
repair Penzance pier were fatal to the horses who drew them, although
they were young and healthy.</p>
<p>In the adjacent parish of Newlyn, a fishing village, the favourite
resort of artists, a great deal of gossiping on summer evenings goes on
around the small wells (here called peeths), whilst the women wait
patiently for each in turn to fill her earthen pitchers; some of the
most industrious bring their knitting in their pockets with them.
Opposite one of these wells, towering over <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s church, is a striking pile of rocks,
&ldquo;Tolcarn.&rdquo; On the summit are some curious markings in the
stones, which, when a child, I was told were the devil&rsquo;s
footprints; but the following legend, which I give on the authority of
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. S. Lach-Szyrma, Vicar of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter&rsquo;s, is quite new to
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summit of the rock is reticulated with curious veins of
elvan, about which a quaint Cornish legend relates that the Bucca-boo,
or storm-god of the old Cornish, once stole the fishermen&rsquo;s net.
Being pursued by Paul choir, who sang the Creed, he flew to the top of
Paul hill and thence over the Coombe to Tolcarn, where he turned the
nets into stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have now reached the town of Penzance, and through its streets
folks of the last generation often heard rumbling at midnight an
old-fashioned coach drawn by headless horses; or saw a procession of
coffins slowly wending its way to the churchyard. It was unlucky to
meet this, as death was sure soon to follow, and tradition speaks of a
woman who accidentally struck against one and died in the same night. A
coach with headless horses and coachman, also just before Christmas,
went through the streets of Penryn; this coachman had the power of
spiriting away people who met and stared at him, unless they turned
their heads and averted the evil by some mystical signs. In Penzance
town were many haunted houses, but space will only allow of my noticing
a few. One in Chapel Street (formerly Our Lady&rsquo;s Street) was
tenanted by the spirit of Mrs. Baines, an eccentric old lady. At the
back of her house was a very fine orchard well stocked with
fruit-trees, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>the boys were too fond of visiting. She
determined at last that her gardener should watch for them, armed with
an old blunderbuss, charged with peas and small shot. She gave him
strict orders should he see any one, to say one, two, three, and then
fire. He watched two nights, but the boys were too cunning for him, and
still the fruit went. On the third, Mrs. Baines, thinking to catch him
napping, went herself into the garden and began to shake the apples
down from one of the trees. Some say that the man recognised his
mistress, and, vexed at her suspecting him, said one, two, three, as
quickly as he could utter the words, and fired; others, that he was
sleeping, and awakened by the noise she made, shot her by mistake,
exclaiming, &ldquo;I know-ee, you thief, I do; now I&rsquo;ll sarve-ee
out, I will.&rdquo; Terrified after he had done the deed, he ran off
into the country and there hid himself for some days. The poor old lady
was more frightened than hurt, and all the shot were successfully
extracted by her doctor; but very soon after this adventure she died.
From this time her house and grounds began to have an evil reputation;
Mrs. Baines&rsquo;s ghost, dressed in antiquated garb, a quaint lace
cap on her powdered hair, lace ruffles hanging from her sleeves, and a
short <i>mode</i> mantle over her shoulders, was often seen walking in
the gardens or standing under an apple-tree, leaning on the gold-headed
cane she always carried. Indoors, too, her high-heeled shoes were
plainly heard night after night tapping on the floors as she paced up
and down the rooms, which noise was often varied by the whirring of her
spinning-wheel. For some time the house was unoccupied, now it is
divided into two, and the ghost has been laid to rest. But long after
Mrs. Baines ceased to appear her wheel was heard. At last it was
discovered that some leather, which had been nailed around a door to
keep out draughts, was loose in places, and that the whistling of the
wind through this made the peculiar sound. Mr. Bottrell says
&ldquo;that her spirit was laid by a parson, whose name he thinks was
Singleton, and he succeeded in getting her away to the Western Green
(west of Penzance), which was then spread over many acres of land,
where the waves now roll.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2316src" href=
"#xd25e2316" name="xd25e2316src">9</a> Here this powerful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>parson
single-handed bound her to spin from the banks, ropes of sand for the
term of a thousand years, unless she, before that time, spun a
sufficiently long and strong one to reach from <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Michael&rsquo;s Mount to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Clement&rsquo;s Isle (across the bay).&rdquo; About
a stone&rsquo;s throw from Mrs. Baines&rsquo;s house, on an eminence
above Quay street, stood in her days Penzance Chapel of Ease (for
Penzance was then in Madron parish), called our Lady&rsquo;s or
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s Chapel. On the same site
was built, in 1835, the present parish church of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s. Here, in the memory of a few who still
survive, a gentleman in the early part of this century did penance, and
afterwards walked from thence through the streets to his house, wrapped
in a sheet, with a lighted taper in his hand. It was usual then, as
now, for the Mayor and Corporation of Penzance, with the mace-bearers
and constables, to go once a month in state to church. Before the
reading of the first lesson the mace-bearers left, and visited the
public-houses, in order to see that they were shut during service time.
When the sermon began they came back and returned to their seats in
order to be in readiness to escort the Mayor home. Quay street was once
the most fashionable part of Penzance, but the large houses are now
divided into smaller tenements; in some of them bits of finely-moulded
ceilings, &amp;c., still exist. One of the houses reputed to have been
haunted was torn down in 1813, when the skeleton of a man was found
built into a wall. It was, of course, put down to be the sailor&rsquo;s
whose spirit was so often seen there, and who (tradition said) had been
murdered in that house for the sake of his money. It was well known
that he had brought back great riches from foreign parts. There is a
myth that Sir Walter Raleigh landed at Penzance Quay when he returned
from Virginia, and on it smoked the first tobacco ever seen in England,
but for this statement I believe there is not the slightest foundation.
Several western ports, both in Devon and Cornwall, make the same
boast.</p>
<p>It is a fact, however, that the news of Nelson&rsquo;s death was
first heard here. It was brought into the port by two fishermen, who
had it from the crew of a passing vessel. A small company of strolling
actors were playing that night at the little theatre then standing over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>some stables in Chapel street, and the play was
stopped for a few moments whilst one of the actors told the
audience.</p>
<p>Another haunted house, at the opposite side of Penzance, is
celebrated in a poem called &ldquo;The Petition of an Old Uninhabited
House,&rdquo; written and published in 1811, by the <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> C. V. Le Grice, who was then Vicar of Madron. He
was a friend of Charles Lamb, who mentions him in his &ldquo;Essay on
Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.&rdquo; About this house a lady once told me a
strange story, that I will relate. Forty years ago, she, a perfect
stranger to the place, never having been in Penzance before, came to it
with her husband and her first child, for she was then a young wife. As
they meant to settle in the town, they went to this hotel, where they
intended staying until they could get a suitable house. On the evening
of their arrival, her husband having gone out, she sat alone before the
fire nursing her child, when she suddenly saw a little old man, in a
very old-fashioned dress, come into the room. He sat down in a chair
near her, looked steadfastly into the fire, and, after some time,
without saying a word, he rose and left. On her husband&rsquo;s return,
she told him of her queer visitor. The next morning they made enquiries
about him, and found that the hotel had been built on the site of the
old uninhabited house; that nearly the whole of it had been destroyed,
but a few of the best rooms remained; and that they were in a haunted
chamber. She declared that she could never sleep there another night,
and, temporarily, they engaged some furnished lodgings. These old rooms
are now pulled down and billiard and other rooms cover the place where
they stood.</p>
<p>Outside the boundary-stone, west of Penzance, stands, in its own
grounds, a house to which additions have been made by many succeeding
generations. Tradition, of course, gave it a ghost. With the other
members of my family I lived there for several years, but none of us
ever saw it. I am bound, however, to state that we never slept in the
haunted chamber. For a short period it was occupied by a groom, who one
morning came to me with a very long face, and said he dared not sleep
there any more, for some mysterious being came night after night, and
pulled all the bed-clothes off him; rather than do so, he would sleep
in the harness-room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>Still further west of Penzance is a much larger house, to which,
like the former, many additions have been made. And up its avenue,
after dark, a carriage may be often heard slowly making its way until
it reaches the hall-door, where it stops. In this house, about sixty
years ago, lived, in very great style, a gentleman, who was a regular
autocrat, and of him one of his old servants related to me this
anecdote, which is curious as an illustration of the manners of those
times. When in his employ, he gave an answer to some question, which
afterwards his master discovered to be an untruth. The next Sunday he
made him, as the congregation came out, stand at Madron church door, by
a tombstone covered with loaves of bread. Of these, he had to give one
to each poor person that passed, and say, in an audible tone, &ldquo;I,
William &mdash;&mdash;, last week told my master a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. G. B. Millett, in his <i>Penzance Past and Present</i>, gives a
tale well known in this district, about the drinking habits of our
ancestors, which, as I am now on the subject of manners, I will
quote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A particular gentleman, not far from Penzance, loved good
liquor, and one evening had gathered some of his jovial companions
together, determined to make a night of it. His wife, having had some
experience of such gatherings before, with wise precaution, saw as much
wine taken out of the cellar as she thought would be good for her
husband and his friends. Then, safely locking the strong oak door, she
put the key in her pocket, and announced her intention of spending the
evening with some lady friends. The hours were passing pleasantly away,
and, with a smile of inward satisfaction, she was congratulating
herself upon the success of her forethought, when a heavy stumbling
noise was heard upon the stairs, and shortly afterwards two burly
footmen staggered into the room, groaning under the weight of a
ponderous cellar door, with its posts and lintel, which had been sent
by their master for the mistress to unlock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manor of Conerton, which at one time nearly included the whole
of West Penwith, had many privileges in Penzance. Before the days of
county courts the lord held a monthly court here for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>the
trial of small cases not criminal. Its prison, a wretched place
(visited by Howard), no longer exists, but people were confined there
early in this century&mdash;sometimes for long periods. I was once
shown a beautiful patchwork quilt made by a poor woman, who had been
imprisoned for debt.</p>
<p>Until within the last fifty years every butcher in Penzance market
had to pay to the bailiff of this manor at Christmas a marrow-bone or a
shilling. The first butcher who refused to pay it also defied one of
the bye-laws of the market that compelled them to wear white sleeves
over their blue blouses. He was brought before the magistrates, and
declared &ldquo;that he would be incarcerated before he would do
it.&rdquo; The following is a favourite story handed down amongst the
butchers from father to son. A solicitor in Penzance had a very large
dog that was in the habit of coming into their market and stealing
joints of meat from the stalls. One day one of them went to the lawyer,
and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Please sir, could I sue the owner of a dog for a
leg of mutton stolen from my stall?&rdquo; &ldquo;Certainly, my good
man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then, please sir, the dog is yours, and the price of
the mutton is <abbr title="4 shilling 6 pence">4<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i></abbr>&rdquo; The money was paid, and the man was going away
in triumph, when he was called back by these words: &ldquo;Stay a
moment, my good man, a lawyer&rsquo;s consultation is <abbr title=
"6 shilling 8 pence">6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr>, you owe me the
difference:&rdquo; which sum the discomfited butcher had to pay.</p>
<p>Every stream in Cornwall however small is called a river (pronounced
revvur). One flows into the sea west of Penzance, between it and
Newlyn, known as Laregan, and another at the east in Gulval parish, as
Ponsandane river. There is an old rhyme about them that runs thus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When Ponsandane calls to Laregan river,</p>
<p class="line">There will be fine weather.</p>
<p class="line">But we may look for rain</p>
<p class="line">When Laregan calls to Ponsandane.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Years ago there was a marsh between Penzance and
Newlyn, now covered by the sea, known to the old people as the
&ldquo;Clodgy;&rdquo; when the sea moaned there they said,
&ldquo;Clodgy is calling for rain.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>Sometimes at the present
day it is &ldquo;Bucca&rdquo; is calling, Bucca being the nickname in

<p class="first">The marsh on Marazion Green still exists, and not many
years ago no one cared to cross it after nightfall, especially on
horseback, for at a certain spot close by the marsh a white lady was
sure to arise from the ground, jump on the rider&rsquo;s saddle, and,
like the &ldquo;White Lady of Avenel,&rdquo; ride with him
pillion-fashion as far as the Red river<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2410src" href="#xd25e2410" name="xd25e2410src">10</a> that runs
into the sea just below the smelting-works at Chyandour, a suburb of
Penzance. The last person who saw her was a tailor of this town, who
died in 1840. He was commonly called &ldquo;Buck Billy,&rdquo; from his
wearing till the day of his death a pigtail, a buff waistcoat, and a
blue coat with yellow buttons.</p>
<p>Marazion, or Market-jew, which latter is a corruption of its old
Cornish name, Marghaisewe, meaning a Thursday&rsquo;s market, is a
small town exactly opposite <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael&rsquo;s Mount. Until its present church was built its mayor sat
in a very high seat with his back against a window. This is the origin
of the Cornish proverb: &ldquo;In your own light, like the mayor of
Market-jew.&rdquo; This mayor is jokingly said to have three
privileges. The first is, &ldquo;That he may sit in his own
light;&rdquo; the second, &ldquo;Next to the parson;&rdquo; and the
third, &ldquo;If he see a pig in a gutter he may turn it out and take
its place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2418src" href="#xd25e2418"

century, was Chancellor of Exeter Cathedral. His ghost is very
eccentric, sometimes getting into a passion, and on these occasions
raising a great storm of wind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86"

<p>In the parish of Breage, near the sea, about four miles from
Marazion, are the ruins of Pengersick Castle, of which only some
fragments of walls and a square tower now stand. Some of the upper
rooms in the latter have fallen in, and they are all in a state of
decay. The lower have oak-panels curiously carved and painted, but time
has almost effaced the designs. The most perfect is one representing
&ldquo;Perseverance,&rdquo; under which are the following lines:</p>
<div lang="en" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;What thing is harder than the rock?</p>
<p class="line">What softer is than water cleere?</p>
<p class="line">Yet wyll the same, with often droppe,</p>
<p class="line">The hard rock perce as doth a spere.</p>
<p class="line">Even so, nothing so hard to attayne,</p>
<p class="line">But may be hadde, with labour and payne.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So many are the legends told of the former inhabitants
of Pengersick, that it would be almost impossible at this date to
decide which is the original. These ruins stand on the site of a much
older castle, and in it dwelt, far back in the dark ages, a very wicked
man, who, when he was fighting in foreign parts, forgetting his wife at
home, courted a king&rsquo;s daughter, who gave him a magic sword,
which ensured in every battle the victory to its owner. He deceived and
left her; but she, with her son in her arms, followed him to his home
by the Mount. There she met him, and upbraided him with his cruelty,
and in a fit of passion he threw them both into the sea. The lady was
drowned, and after her death she was changed into a white hare, which
continually haunted the old lord; but her boy was picked up alive by a
passing ship. The lord&rsquo;s wife afterwards died, and he married
again a woman as bad as himself, reputed to be a witch, who was very
cruel to her step-son, who lived with his father at the castle. One
night there was a great storm in Mount&rsquo;s Bay, and the young man
went down to the shore to see if there were any vessels in distress,
and spied on the beach an almost exhausted sailor, who had been washed
in by the waves, and whom he bade his servants carry to his home, and
put into his own bed. When he revived, all were struck by the
marvellous resemblance to the young heir; and they conceived a great
affection for each other. Together they went to Marazion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>to see
if they could find the vessel from whose deck the stranger had fallen
into the sea. It was safe in harbour, and the captain, whom the sailor
had always thought to be his father, told him then for the first time,
&ldquo;How, when he was an infant, he had rescued him from drowning
where last night he had nearly lost his life.&rdquo; Thus they were
discovered to be brothers, and a day or two after, when out hunting,
guided by the white hare, they accidentally came upon the miraculous
sword that had disappeared when his mother was drowned. Then these two
brothers sailed away from Cornwall, and dwelt in peace in the land of a
strange princess; where the Cornishman studied, under a celebrated
master, astrology and all other occult sciences. After some time the
old lord of Pengersick met his death in this wise: As he was riding out
one fine morning, the white hare suddenly sprang up in front of his
horse and startled it, so that it ran madly with its rider into the
sea, where both were swallowed up. When this news was brought to him,
the Cornishman bade his brother an affectionate farewell, and, with his
wife, a learned princess, went back to Pengersick, where they lived
happily for several generations, for amongst many other wonderful
things, the young lord had discovered an elixir of life which, had they
so wished, would have kept them alive to the present day. (<i>See</i>
Bottrell.)</p>
<p>In addition to being well versed in occult lore, Pengersick&rsquo;s
wife was a fine musician; she could with her harp charm and subdue evil
spirits, and compel the fish in Mount&rsquo;s Bay, also the mermaids
who then dwelt there, to come out of the sea.</p>
<p>Another account of the old lord&rsquo;s death says that he and a
party of his friends were dining in his yacht around a silver table
when she went down, and all on board perished. This happened off Cudden
Point, which juts into the sea just opposite Pengersick. Children
living there formerly used to go down to the beach at low water to try
and find this silver table. (A ship laden with bullion is reported to
have been lost here in the time of Queen Elizabeth.) &ldquo;The present
castle,&rdquo; one tradition says, &ldquo;was built in the reign of
Henry VIII. by a merchant who had acquired immense wealth beyond the
seas, and who loaded an ass with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>gold, and broke its back. He
sold the castle to a Mr. Milliton, who, having slain a man, shut
himself up in it to escape punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another legend says that Sir William Milliton built it, and, soon
after its completion, married a very rich but extremely ugly and
shrewish woman, of whom he tried by various ways to rid himself but in
vain. One day, after a desperate quarrel, he begged her forgiveness,
and asked her, in proof of having pardoned him, to sup with him that
evening in a room overlooking the sea. She agreed; and at the
conclusion of the feast they pledged each other in goblets of rich
wine. Then Sir William&rsquo;s looks altered, and, in a fierce voice,
he said, &ldquo;Woman, now prepare for death! You have but a short time
to live, as the wine that you have just drunk was poisoned.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then we die together,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for I had my
suspicions, and mixed the contents of the goblets.&rdquo; Up to this
time the moon, which was at its full, had been shining brightly through
the open windows, for it was a warm summer night, when suddenly a
frightful storm of thunder and lightning arose, the winds lashed the
waves to fury, and the moon was darkened. The servants, alarmed by
this, and the unearthly fiendish yells that came from the banqueting
hall, rushed upstairs, and there found the bodies of their master and
mistress dead on the floor; and through the open window they saw, by
the light of the moon which for a moment shone through a rift in the
clouds, their souls borne away on the wings of a demon in the shape of
a bird.</p>
<p>The original name of Breage parish was Pembro; but <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Breaca, hearing that the inhabitants were at a loss
to raise the money for a peal of bells, offered to extricate them from
their difficulty on condition that they should call the parish after
her. The condition was accepted, the bells were hung, and the parish
henceforth was known as that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Breage.&mdash;Through <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle.</p>
<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germoe (Geronicus) an Irish king, who
was converted to Christianity in the fifth century, is said to have
been the foster-son of Breaca (or Breage), with whom he crossed over
into Cornwall where they settled. Two churches in adjoining parishes
are dedicated to them; <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germoe is reputed
to have been the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=

at the north-east of the churchyard, known as <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Germoe&rsquo;s chair or King Germoe&rsquo;s
throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is more than one story attached to this chair. One is
to the effect that the saint sat in the central chair with two
assessors, one on either side of him; another legend is that the
priests rested in the chair; whilst a third is that pilgrims to the
tomb of the saint also rested therein. Be that as it may, however, it
is possible that this is a shrine, and that the body of <abbr title=

it.&rdquo;&mdash;<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> W. A. Osborne,

<p>All Cornishmen at one time were supposed to be
&ldquo;wreckers,&rdquo; and from the peninsular-shape of their county
came the proverb, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a bad wind that blows no good to
Cornwall.&rdquo; But the dwellers in Breage and Germoe must in olden
times, from the following distich, have been held in worse repute than
their neighbours:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The most noted and daring Cornish smuggler of the last
century, Coppinger, a Dane, lived on the north coast, and of him a
legendary catalogue of dreadful tales is told, all to be found in the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. S. Hawker&rsquo;s book, the
<i>Footprints of Former Men in Far Cornwall</i>. He lays the scene of
his exploits in the neighbourhood of Hartland Bay, my informant near
Newquay. He swam ashore here in the prime of life, in the middle of a
frightful storm, from a foreign-rigged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>vessel that was seen in
the offing, and of which nothing more was ever heard or known. Wrapped
in a cloak, that tradition says he tore from off the shoulders of an
old woman who was on the beach, he jumped up behind a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter, who had ridden down to see the wreck, and was by her taken to
her father&rsquo;s house, where he was fed, clothed, and most
hospitably received. He was a fine, handsome, well-built man, and gave
himself out to be most highly connected in his own country. He soon won
the young woman&rsquo;s affections, and at her father&rsquo;s death,
which took place not long after, he easily induced her to marry him;
but it was far from a happy union. Luckily they had but one
child&mdash;a deaf and dumb idiot, who had inherited his father&rsquo;s
cruel disposition, and delighted in torturing all living things. It is
even said that he cunningly killed one of his young playmates.
Coppinger, after his marriage, organized a band of smugglers, and made
himself their captain; and quickly through his misdeeds earned the
title of cruel Coppinger. One legend relates that he once led a Revenue
cutter into a dangerous cove, of which he alone knew the soundings, and
that he and his crew came out of it in safety, but the other vessel
with all on board perished. Mr. Hawker calls Coppinger&rsquo;s ship the
&ldquo;Black Prince,&rdquo; and says he had it built for himself in
Denmark, and that men who had made themselves in any way obnoxious to
him on land were carried on board her, and compelled by fearful oaths
to enrol themselves in her crew.</p>
<p>In 1835 an old man of the age of ninety-seven related to this writer
that when a youth he had been so abducted, and after two years&rsquo;
service he had been ransomed by his friends with a large sum.
&ldquo;And all,&rdquo; said the old man, very simply, &ldquo;because I
happened to see one man kill another, and they thought I should mention
it.&rdquo; The same author gives him a wonderfully fleet horse, which
no one but Coppinger could master, and says that on its back he made
more than one hairbreadth escape. He has also a marvellous account of
his end, in which he disappears as he came, in a vessel which he
boarded in a storm of thunder, lightning, and hail. As soon as he was
in her, &ldquo;she was out of sight in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>a moment, like a spectre
or a ghost.&rdquo; For this he quotes the following verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Will you hear of the cruel Coppinger?</p>
<p class="line xd25e1242">He came from a foreign kind;</p>
<p class="line">He was brought to us from the salt water,</p>
<p class="line xd25e1242">He was carried away by the wind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The one thing certain about him is, that at one time
he amassed money enough by smuggling to buy a small freehold estate
near the sea, the title-deeds of which, signed with his name, still
exist. But in his old age, I have been told, he was reduced to poverty,
and subsisted on charity.</p>
<p>That in those bygone days smuggling was thought no sin every one
knows. And who has not heard the oft-quoted apocryphal anecdote of the
Cornish clergyman, who&mdash;when he was in the middle of his sermon
and some one opened the church door and shouted in, &ldquo;A wreck! a
wreck!&rdquo;&mdash;begged his parishioners to wait whilst he took off
his gown that they might all start fair.</p>
<p>The following is, however, a genuine letter of the last century from
a vicar in the eastern part of the county to a noted smuggler of that
district:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Martin Rowe, you very well know,</p>

anker.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To the same jovial vicar is credited this grace, given
to his hostess&rsquo; horror at her table after he had dined out
several days in succession, and had rabbits offered him, a dish he
detested:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Inland from Breage is the small hamlet of
Leed&rsquo;s-town (called after the Duke of Leeds, who has property in
Cornwall). It is the seat of the following short
story:&mdash;&ldquo;The Leed&rsquo;s-town ghost runs up and down stairs
in a house during the night, and then sits in a corner of the room
weeping and sleeking her hair. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>is the ghost of a young woman
who was engaged to be married to a man who refused to become her
husband until she gave him certain deeds kept in a box in the above
room. As soon as the deeds were in his possession, he realised the
property and escaped to America, leaving the luckless girl to bemoan
her loss. She went mad: night and day she was searching for her deeds;
sometimes she would sit and wail in the spot where the box had been. At
length she died: her spirit, however, had no rest, and still constantly
returns to keep alive the memory of man&rsquo;s
perfidy.&rdquo;&mdash;Through <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S.
Rundle.</p>
<p>Close to Leed&rsquo;s-town, at the foot of Godolphin-hill, is the
old house, or hall, of Godolphin. The basement-floor of the original
house alone remains: it consists of a long fa&ccedil;ade supported by
pillars of white granite, the interior containing many objects of
interest well worth a visit. Opposite the inhabited part of the house
is the King&rsquo;s room, opening on the King&rsquo;s garden. (The
title of King&rsquo;s room was given to it from the legend that Charles
II. once slept there.) You could leave it by five ways; as there were
three doors, one exit through the floor, and another through the roof.
Godolphin is held by a very curious tenure, said to have originated in
a bet between the representatives of the Godolphin and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn families on a snail race. As the Godolphin
snail was being beaten, its owner pricked it with a pin to make it go
faster, but it drew in its horns and refused to move, consequently the
other won. The following is the ceremony which takes place every
Candlemas. Before sunrise a person, appointed as reeve by the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn
Molesworth <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, the lord of the manor
of Lamburn, in the parish of Perranzabuloe (near Truro), knocks at the
ancient outer door of the quadrangle, and repeats this demand
thrice:&mdash;&ldquo;Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Here come I the reeve of the
manor of Lamburn, to demand my lord&rsquo;s dues, eight groats and a
penny in money, a loaf, a cheese, a collar of brawn, and a jack of the
best ale in the house. God save the Queen and the lord of the
manor.&rdquo; It is said at the outer door of the quadrangle, at the
inner door, and for the third and last time at the table in the kitchen
(which is one of the oldest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>and not the least interesting rooms).
The above high lordship is paid by the Duke of Leeds to the
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn family, to whom should they fail
an heir the estate reverts. There is another curious tenure in this
part of Cornwall, which as I am on the subject I will, before
proceeding further, quote. &ldquo;The parsonage of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Grade, with a small portion of land, including an
orchard, is held of the manor of Erisey by the following tenure, viz.,
that on Easter-day, yearly, the parson provide a dinner for the master
and mistress of Erisey house, and their man and maid, with a pan of
milk for a greyhound bitch.&rdquo;&mdash;Lake, <i>Helston and
Lizard</i>.</p>
<p>The old manor-house of Erisey is in Ruan Major (near the Lizard),
and of one of the family the following story is told:&mdash;&ldquo;He
was dancing with other ladies and gentlemen at Whitehall before James
I., and, through the violent motion and action of his body in the
middle of the dance, had his cap slip from his head and fall to the
ground; but he instantly with his foot tossed it on his head again, and
proceeded without let or hindrance with his part in that dance, to the
admiration of all who saw it, which gave occasion to King James to
enquire who that active gentleman was, and being told that his name was
Erisey, he forthwith replied, &lsquo;I like the gentleman very well,
but not his name of Heresey!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The rector of Ruan
Minor by ancient usage and prescription (which is always admitted)
claims a right of sending a horse into a certain field in the parish of
Landewednack, whenever it is cropped with corn, and taking away as many
sheaves as the horse can carry away on its back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Jew&rsquo;s Lane Hill, near Godolphin, a Jew is said to
have hung himself on a tree still pointed out, and was buried beneath
the road. His ghost appears in the shape of a bull and a fiery chariot.
This superstition has been known for generations.&rdquo;&mdash;M. H.,

periodically to assemble to hear the news from Court. The servants who
waited on their masters at the banquet diligently listened to the
conversation, and afterwards spread the information thus collected

<p>An old writer on the Scilly Isles mentions a rock on Bryher, one of
the smallest of the islands, where the neighbours were wont to collect
to hear and repeat the news. He calls it the News Rock.</p>
<p>Between Helston and the Lizard lies the parish of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne; unlike the other parishes of Cornwall it
contains no mines. To account for this it is said that <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne cursed it when he lived there, for the want
of respect shown him by its inhabitants. Hence the proverb &ldquo;No
metal will run within the sound of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Keverne&rsquo;s bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, from the Land&rsquo;s End
district, once paid a visit to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne,
who entertained him for several days to the best of his power. After
his departure his host missed some valuable relics, and determined to
go in pursuit of his late guest, and try, if possible, to get them from
him. As he was passing over Crousadown, about two miles from
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne church, he pocketed three large
stones, each weighing about a quarter of a ton, to use if <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Just should offer any resistance. He overtook him at
a short distance from Breage and taxed him with the theft, which was
indignantly denied. From words the saints came to blows, and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Keverne flung his stones with such
effect that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just ran off, throwing down
the relics as he ran. These stones lay for centuries where they fell,
about four hundred yards from Pengersick Lane, as when taken away by
day, they were in bygone times always brought back at night.</p>
<p>Going along the coast from Breage to the Lizard the solitary church
of Gunwalloe is passed, built so close to the sea that the waves wash
its graveyard walls. It is said to have been erected as a
thank-offering by some man who escaped drowning when shipwrecked.
&ldquo;In the sandbanks near it (or, as others say, at <span class=

the vicar, and the following quaint lines to his memory may still be

</div>
<p class="first">Of him the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> C. A.
Johns writes:&mdash;&ldquo;This Thomas Flavel, during his life,
attained great celebrity for his skill in the questionable art of
laying ghosts. His fame still lingers in the memories of the more
superstitious of the inhabitants through the following ridiculous
stories. On one occasion when he had gone to church his servant-girl
opened a book in his study, whereupon a host of spirits sprang up all
round her. Her master observed this, though then occupied at church,
closed his book, and dismissed the congregation. On his return home he
took up the book with which his servant had been meddling, and read
backwards the passage which she had been reading, at the same time
laying about him lustily with his walking-cane, whereupon all the
spirits took their departure, but not before they had pinched the
servant-girl black and blue. His celebrity, it seems, was not confined
to his own parish, for he was once called on to lay a very troublesome
ghost in an adjoining parish. As he demanded the large fee of five
guineas for his services, two of the persons interested resolved to
assure themselves, by the evidence of their own eyes, that the ceremony
was duly performed. They accordingly, without apprising one another of
their intention, secreted themselves behind two graves in the
churchyard a short time before the hour named for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>the
absurd rites. In due time the ghost-layer entered it with a book in one
hand and a horsewhip in the other. On the first smack of the whip the
watchers raised their heads simultaneously, caught a glimpse of each
other, and were both so terrified that they scampered off in opposite
directions, leaving the operator to finish his business as he might. So
popular are superstitions of this kind, and so long do they linger,
that to the present day a spot is pointed out on the downs, named
&lsquo;Hervan Gutter,&rsquo; where Thomas Flavel&rsquo;s own ghost was
laid by a clergyman, of whom he said before his death, &lsquo;When he
comes I must go.&rsquo; In olden days there were several of these
ghost-laying clergymen in Cornwall, of whom, before going on with the
legends of the parishes, I will mention three known in folk-lore. In
the parish of Ladock, on the east side of Truro, dwelt rather more than
a century ago the famed ghost-layer, the <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Woods, who, when walking, usually carried an
ebony stick with a silver head, on which was engraved a pentacle, and
on a broad silver ring below planetary signs and mystical figures. Of
him Mr. Bottrell tells many thrilling tales; I will only give the
substance of one. Mr. Woods was usually a match for most demons, whom
he would change into animals and thrash with his whip; but one more
cunning than the rest defied him, by taking the shape of an unknown
coal-black bird, and perching on the church tower, from whence during
divine service he made all sorts of queer noises, disturbing the
congregation, and inciting the irreverent to laughter. He was too high
up to be exorcised or reached with the whip. At last the clergyman, at
his wit&rsquo;s end, remembered that the Evil One could not endure the
sight of innocent children, and he sent his clerk round to all the
mothers of his parish who had unchristened children, asking them to
bring them to church on the next Sunday to have the rite performed. As
he was a great favourite with his people all the mothers, and they were
eight, readily agreed to come. But as twelve is the mystical number he
invited four other mothers whose children had recently been baptised,
to come as well, and bring their children and sponsors with them. The
eight children were christened, and the parson walked out of church
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

in their arms. The clerk arranged them in lines five deep, the mothers
in front, opposite the belfry door. Mr. Woods directed each to pass her
child from one to the other of its sponsors, and then hand it to him
that he might hold it up for the demon to see; but for some time the
cunning bird hid himself behind a pinnacle, and nothing would induce
him to look, until one of the children, growing tired, began to cry,
and all the others chimed in, screaming in chorus at the top of their
voices. Then the demon hopped down from his perch and peered over the
parapet to try and find out what could be the matter. The sight of the
twelve children had such an effect upon him that he too gave an
unearthly yell and flew away never to re-appear. The church bells were
soon after put in order, and it is well known that no evil spirit ever
ventures within sound of their ringing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the three Jagos, who were Vicars of Wendron, was much
renowned for his powers of necromancy. He was in the habit of taking
people to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wendron Cross, where a man
called Tucker was buried, and asking them whether they had a mind to
see Tucker man; he would make him rise from the dead as a mark of
delicate attention to them.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Cornubiana</i>,

<p>I will close this list of worthies by a short notice of Parson
Dodge, a vicar of Talland, a village on the south coast of Cornwall,
and then give an encounter of the famous Nonconformist divine, John
Wesley, with some spirits whom he vanquished at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes on the north. The church of Talland is not in
the centre of the parish, but near the sea; a legend accounts for its
position thus: It was begun at a spot called Pulpit, but each night a
voice was heard saying:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If you will my wish fulfil,</p>
<p class="line">Build the church on Talland hill;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and the stones put up by day were removed. (Tales
similar to this are told of many Cornish churches. The work of removal
is sometimes carried on by the devil; at Altarnon he was accompanied
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>by a hare and a deer.) Of this church, about a
hundred and fifty years ago, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Richard Dodge was vicar. He had such command over the spirit-world that
he could raise and lay ghosts at his will, and by a nod of his head
banish them to the Red Sea. His parishioners looked up to him with
great awe, and were afraid of meeting him at midnight, as he was sure
then, whip in hand, to be pursuing and driving away the demons, that in
all kinds of shapes were to be seen hovering around him. Amongst his
other eccentricities he was fond of frequenting his churchyard at the
dead of night. Parson Dodge&rsquo;s fame was not confined to his own
immediate district, and one day he received a letter from a
fellow-clergyman, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Grylls, rector
of Lanreath, asking his assistance in exorcising a man habited in
black, who drove a sable coach, drawn by headless horses, across
Black-a-down (a neighbouring moor), as this apparition, when they
happened to meet it, frightened his people almost out of their wits. He
acceded to this request, and late at night the two clergymen rode to
the spot, where they waited for some time, but seeing nothing decided
to separate and return to their respective homes. Mr. Dodge, however,
had not gone very far when his horse obstinately refused to proceed a
step further in a homeward direction: this he interpreted to be a sign
from heaven which he must obey, and giving it the rein he allowed it to
go as it willed. It wheeled round and went back at a great pace to the
moor. Here through the gloom he saw standing the black coach with the
headless horses: its driver had dismounted, and the <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Grylls lay in a swoon at his feet. Mr. Dodge was
terribly alarmed, but managed to keep his presence of mind, and began
to recite a prayer: before he could finish it the driver
said&mdash;&ldquo;Dodge is come! I must be gone!&rdquo; jumped on to
his seat and disappeared for ever. Mr. Grylls&rsquo; parishioners now
arrived in search of their rector; they knew there must be something
amiss, for his horse, startled by the horrible spectres, had thrown its
rider and galloped off, never stopping until it reached its stable (his
friend&rsquo;s, through fright, had also been, until the apparition
vanished, almost unmanageable). They found him senseless, supported
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>in Mr. Dodge&rsquo;s arms; but he soon revived,
and they took him home, although it was some days before his reason
recovered from the shock. A much fuller account of this may be found in
the <i>History of Polperro</i>, by Mr. T. Q. Couch. It has also been
published by Mr. Robert Hunt in his <i>Popular Romances of the West of
England</i>. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. S. Hawker, in
his <i>Footprints of Former Men in Far Cornwall</i>, gives some very
interesting extracts from the &ldquo;Diurnal&rdquo; of one Parson
Rudall, of Launceston, who in 1665, with the sanction of his Bishop,
laid the Botathen ghost&mdash;the spirit of a young woman by name
Dorothy Dinglet, who could not rest in her grave&mdash;&ldquo;Unquiet
because of a certain sin.&rdquo; It is a very well-known fact that the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Wesley was a firm believer in
supernatural agencies; he compiled a book of ghost-stories, that was
lent to me when I was about ten years old by a kind but ignorant woman,
the reading of which caused me many sleepless nights. &ldquo;On one
occasion Wesley could, when at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes,
find no place to pass the night save a house which had the reputation
of being haunted. However, he was not deterred; he entered and went to
bed. But he could not rest, for there was a terrible tumult below; the
sound of carriages was heard, the noise of feet, and fearful oaths. At
length he could bear it no longer; he descended, and then found the
large hall filled with guests. They greeted him with loud welcome, and
begged him to be seated. He consented, saying, however, that he must
say grace first. This remark was hailed with roars of laughter. Nothing
daunted he began&mdash;&ldquo;Jesus, the Name high over all.&rdquo; He
did not finish; in a moment the lights were extinguished, he was alone,
and from that time the house was no more haunted.&mdash;Through
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle.</p>
<p>Clergymen in Cornwall are still supposed to be able to drive out
evil spirits. A poor, half-crazed woman, yet living in Madron parish,
near Penzance, went about ten years since to the house of a clergyman
then residing there, and asked him to walk around her, reading some
passages from the Bible, to exorcise the ghost of her dead sister, who
had entered into her, she said, and tormented her in the shape of a
small fly, which continually buzzed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>her ear. Once before
the Board of Guardians she talked sensibly for some time, then suddenly
stopped and exclaimed, shaking her head: &ldquo;Be quiet, you brute!
don&rsquo;t you see I am talking to the gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must now, after this long digression, return to Mullion. Between
it and the Lizard is a fine headland, the Rill, and on its summit are a
number of loose, rough stones, known as the Apron String, which the
country people say were brought here by an evil spirit, who intended to
build with them a bridge across to France for the convenience of
smugglers. He was hastening along with his load, which he carried in
his apron, when one of its strings broke, and in despair he gave up the
idea. On the opposite side of the Lizard, at the mouth of Helford
river, stands the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony in
Meneage; like that of Gunwalloe it is little above the level of the
sea, and is, also according to tradition, a votive offering. Some
people of high rank, crossing over from Normandy to England, were
caught in a storm, and in their peril vowed to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony that they would build a church in his honour
if he would bring them safe into harbour. The saint heard their
prayers, and the church was erected on the spot where they landed.
Helford river, in Carew&rsquo;s days, was the haunt of pirates, and of
it he says: &ldquo;<span lang="en">Falmouth&rsquo;s ower neere
neighbourhood lesseneth his vse and darkeneth his reputation, as
quitting it onely to the worst sort of Seafarers, I mean Pirats, whose
guilty breasts with an eye in their backs, looke warily how they may
goe out, ere they will aduenture to enter, and this at unfortified
Hailford cannot be controlled, in which regard it not vnproperly
brooketh his common term of Helford and the nickname of
Stealford.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the subject of pirates a friend writes:&mdash;&ldquo;The popular
play of &lsquo;The Pirates of Penzance&rsquo; had not its origin in
that town, but in the little fishing village of Penberth, near the
Land&rsquo;s End; but that, alas! is in its &lsquo;custom port.&rsquo;
The captain of the pirate vessel, and all his ship&rsquo;s crew, were
wrestlers. They would go out to the small Spanish, Dutch, and other
merchant ships, and would ask for provisions, or tender assistance, and
on making sure that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>the ship was unarmed they would overpower
the sailors and plunder it. This was before the time when the Trinity
Corporation had begun its work on our Cornish coast.</p>
<p>From Helford we will proceed to Penryn&mdash;the scene of
Lillo&rsquo;s play, &ldquo;Fatal Curiosity.&rdquo; The legend on which
it is founded is as follows: A gentleman who had rashly squandered his
own and his wife&rsquo;s fortune, sent their only son early into the
world to seek his. During his absence his parents were reduced to
penury; but he prospered, returned home, and sought them out. He did
not at first disclose to them who he was, intending to do so later on,
but begged to be allowed to rest in their house, and whilst he was
sleeping asked his mother to take charge of a casket for him. Her
curiosity impelled her to open it, and her avarice was so inflamed at
the sight of the rich jewels it contained that she incited her husband
by prayers and reproaches to murder the poor young man. After the fatal
deed was done, the unhappy pair discovered him to be their son.</p>
<p>It has been said that a party of Spaniards landed at Penryn in 1565,
intending to plunder the town, but were alarmed by the sound of a drum
beaten by some strolling players, and made a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>Before the year 1600 there were only a few houses where Falmouth now
stands, called Pennycomequick, which name tradition declares was given
it from the following: A woman, who had been a servant to a Mr.
Pendarves, left his employ, and went there to reside, where, I suppose,
she kept an ale-house, as the story says that he ordered her to brew a
cask of ale, and on a certain day he and some friends would come and
drink it. The ale was brewed; but in the meantime a Dutch vessel put
into the creek, and she sold it all to the sailors. When her former
master and his friends arrived at the appointed time, he was of course
very angry. Her excuse was that the &ldquo;penny comed so quick&rdquo;
that she could not refuse it. The name really means the head of the
valley of the creek.</p>
<p>There is a pyramidal monument at the south end of Falmouth erected
by one of the Killigrews to the memory of Sir Walter <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>Raleigh, who had been entertained by an ancestor
at their family-seat of Arwenack, when there was only one other house
in the place. There is a red stain on it, &ldquo;A blood-mark,&rdquo;
the old people said, &ldquo;that would not wash out, splashed there
from the body of a man employed in making it, who fell from its top and
was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the coast just outside the town is Gyllanvaes, or William&rsquo;s
Grave, which is pointed out as the place where King Henry I.&rsquo;s
son, who was drowned on his passage from Normandy to England, was
buried.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of Falmouth harbour, where <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony&rsquo;s church now stands, was formerly the
priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Vale, and King Henry
VIII. is reported to have landed here in 1537, and told the prior that
it would soon be destroyed, and he with all his brethren turned out. It
was; but the prior left his curse behind him, and the first holder of
the lands lost all his family by untimely deaths, and he himself
committed suicide.</p>
<p>Of all the creeks up the Fal from Falmouth to Truro, most marvellous
tales of smugglers and their daring deeds are told; and of King
Harry&rsquo;s passage, where a ferry-boat crosses the river, this
legend: That it is called after bluff King Hal, who forded it with his
queen (sometimes Katherine of Arragon) on his back. To have
accomplished this feat he must have been taller than the sons of Anak,
for in the middle the water is several fathoms deep.</p>
<p>At the head of one of these creeks is Veryan parish. And there is a
tradition that should its church clock strike on the Sunday morning
during the singing of the hymn before the sermon, or before the Collect
against Perils at Evening Prayer (which does not often happen), there
will be a death in the parish before the next Sunday.</p>
<p>On a hill near Veryan is a barrow, in which Gerennius, a mythical
king of Cornwall, was said to have been buried many centuries ago, with
his crown on his head, lying in his golden boat with silver oars. It
was opened in 1855, when nothing but a kistvaen (a rude stone chest)
containing his ashes was found. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>His palace of Dingerein was
in the neighbouring village of Gerrans. A subterranean passage, now
known as Mermaid&rsquo;s Hole, one day discovered when ploughing a
field, was supposed to have led from it to the sea. Treasures of great
value are reputed to be hidden under all the Cornish menhirs and
barrows. Carew tells of a gentleman who was persuaded that by digging
under a menhir near Fowey he would get great riches. &ldquo;<span lang=
"en">Wherefore, in a faire moone-shine night, thither with certaine
good fellowes hee hyeth to dig it up. A working they fall, their labour
shortneth, their hope increaseth, a pot of gold is the least of their
expectation. But see the chance. In midst of their toyling the skie
gathereth clouds, the moonelight is overcast with darknesse, downe fals
a mightie showre, up riseth a blustering tempest, the thunder cracketh,
the lightning flasheth. In conclusion, our money-seekers washed instead
of loden, or loden with water instead of yellow earth, and more afraid
than hurt, are forced to abandon their enterprise and seeke shelter of
the next house they could get into.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malpas (pronounced Mopus) ferry was, nearly a century ago, kept by a
woman called &ldquo;Jenny Mopus,&rdquo; who was quite a character.
&ldquo;Wemmin and pigs&rdquo; she used to declare were the worst things
to ferry across.</p>
<p>The water bounds of the borough of Truro are renewed every six
years, and the following curious ceremony takes place: On reaching the
limits of their jurisdiction, the mayor, town clerk, members of
corporation, &amp;c., go on shore, when a writ for the sum of
<abbr title="999 pounds 19 shilling 11&frac34; pence">999<i>l.</i>
19<i>s.</i> 11&frac34;<i>d.</i></abbr> is produced against a person
present, selected beforehand. He is arrested by the bailiff of the
borough, on which two of the party offer themselves as bail, and the
prisoner is liberated. Not far from Perranworthal is one of the most
celebrated Cornish Tol-m&ecirc;n, M&ecirc;n-an-tol, or holed stones.
This is an immense egg-shaped mass of granite, perched on a dreary hill
nearly 700 feet above the sea, and is thought to weigh 750 tons. It is
generally known as the Cornish Pebble, and is supported on the points
of two other stones leaving a hollow space beneath. In this it differs
from other M&ecirc;n-an-tol which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104"
href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>have the orifice in the
centre of the stone (hence their name). There are many in the county.
The one at Madron is sometimes called the Crick Stone. It gets this
name because in days not very long ago people afflicted with
rheumatism, sciatica, &amp;c., in May, and at certain other seasons of
the year, crawled on all fours nine times around these M&ecirc;n-an-tol
from east to west, and, if thin enough, squeezed themselves through the
aperture. This was then thought such a sovereign remedy for these
diseases that parents brought their weak-backed children and carried
them around. To work the charm properly there must always be two
people, one of each sex, who stand one on each side of the stone. The
child, if a male, must first be passed from the woman to the man; if a
girl, from the man to the woman, and always from the left of the one to
the right of the other. Some sort of divination, too, was formerly
practised on these M&ecirc;n-an-tol by pins laid cross-ways on the
top.</p>
<p>In the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis the church is
dedicated to that saint. And when <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis
had his head cut off at Paris, blood, a legend says, fell on the stones
of this churchyard; a similar occurrence often afterwards foretold
other calamities.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2834src" href="#xd25e2834"
name="xd25e2834src">12</a> The exact centre of the county is reputed to
be a hole in a field at Probus, a neighbouring parish.</p>
<p>At Boconnoc, near Lostwithiel, not long ago stood the stump of an
old oak, in which, in 1644, when Charles I. made this seat his
head-quarters, the royal standard was fixed. It bore variegated leaves.
According to tradition, they changed colour when an attempt was made to
assassinate the king whilst he was receiving the sacrament under its
branches. The ball passed through the tree, and a hole in its trunk was
formerly pointed out in confirmation of the story.</p>
<p>Heath, in his <i>Description of Cornwall</i>, 1750, speaks of two
other trees of the same kind to be seen in this county. &ldquo;In
Lanhadron Park,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;there grows an oak that bears
leaves speckled with white, as another, called Painter&rsquo;s Oak,
grows in the hundred of East. Some are of opinion that divers ancient
families of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>England are preadmonished by oaks bearing
strange leaves.&rdquo; A turtle-dove is said to be seen by the Bassetts
of Tehidy, in Camborne, before death, and to another Cornish family a
white bird appears.</p>
<p>The church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, in the parish of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, is celebrated for its
beautifully-painted glass. One of the windows contains many legends of
this saint, but they have all been too fully described by other writers
to require a lengthy notice from me. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Neot is the reputed brother of King Alfred, and lived some hundreds of
years before the present church dedicated to him was erected. But
folk-lore has it that it was built at night entirely by his own hands,
and that he drew from a neighbouring quarry, by the help of reindeer,
all the stones he used in the building. He is described as a man of
short stature, and tradition also says that after the church was
finished he found that he was not tall enough to reach the keyhole of
the door, and could not therefore unlock it. To remedy this defect he
put a stone opposite (still pointed out), from which, when he stood on
it, he could throw the key into the lock with unerring precision. About
a mile to the west of it, is an elevated spot with a square
entrenchment; an ancient granite cross stands at one corner. There is a
story attached to it which runs thus:&mdash;The crows in this
neighbourhood were in his time so numerous that the farmers could not,
fearing the mischief they might do in their absence, leave their fields
and young crops to attend <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot&rsquo;s
discourses. He, on hearing of it, determined to put a stop both to the
excuse and the thieving habits of the birds, and one day ordered them
all to enter this enclosure, from whence they could not stir until he
gave the signal; upon which they all immediately flew away and returned
no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgan, in
Kerrier, was formerly at Carminowe, at the end of the parish. It was
removed thence to its present site on account of the ghoulish
propensities of the giants, who used to dig up the dead from their
graves. The inhabitants tried in vain to destroy them by making deep
pits, and covering them over with <span class="corr" id="xd25e2865"
title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>sprouse<span class="corr" id=
"xd25e2868" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> (light hay or grass)
so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>the unwary giants, walking over them as on firm
ground, might fall into them and be killed. As this project failed,
they were reluctantly compelled to remove the church to its present
place, beyond the reach of their troublesome
neighbours.&rdquo;&mdash;<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle,
<i>Penzance Natural History Society</i>, 1885&ndash;1886.</p>
<p>The fine old mansion of Cottrell, situated on the River Tamar, was
built in the reign of Henry VII.; it belongs to the Earl of Mount
Edgcumbe, and is full of quaint treasures, many of the rooms and the
furniture they contain dating from the time of Queen Elizabeth. But the
only part that concerns us is a little chapel in the woods perched on a
rock overhanging the river, of which this legend is told. It was
erected by Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who was a partizan to Henry, Duke of
Richmond, the rival of Richard III. A party of soldiers were sent to
take him prisoner, but he managed to elude them and escaped into the
woods, where his pursuers were so close upon his heels that he would
certainly have been captured had not his cap, as he was climbing down
this rock, fallen off his head and floated on the stream. On seeing it
the men, thinking that Sir Richard had in despair drowned himself, gave
up the chase. He shortly after crossed over to Brittany, where he
stayed until the news came of the defeat and death of the king, when he
returned home, and, in gratitude for his miraculous escape, caused this
chapel to be built.</p>
<p>Dupath Well, not far from Cottrell, was, according to tradition, the
scene of a desperate duel between two Saxons, called by one authority
Colan and Gotlieb, who were both suitors for the hand of the fair lady
Gither; but the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. S. Hawker, who
has written a ballad on part of the legend, gives the name of Siward to
the younger and favoured one who killed his rival, but who himself in
the combat received a wound from which he soon after died. The same
author has also put into verse the well-known story of Bottreaux bells.
Bottreaux is the parish church of Boscastle, a corruption of Bottreaux
castle, and its tower is, and always has been, silent. When it was
built the inhabitants, who had long been jealous of the beautiful peal
at Tintagel, a neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>village, aided by the Lord of
Bottreaux, raised enough money to buy a set for themselves, cast by a
famous London founder. But when the ship that brought them was nearly
in port the sound of Tintagel bells was in the calm evening borne
across the water. The pilot, a native of that parish, hearing them,
piously crossed himself, and thanked God that he should soon be safe on
shore. On this the captain grew very wroth, and said, &ldquo;Thank the
ship and the canvas at sea, thank God on shore.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; meekly replied the pilot, &ldquo;we should thank God
at sea as well as on land.&rdquo; At this the captain grew still more
angry, swore and blasphemed, and with an oath exclaimed, &ldquo;Not so,
thank yourself and a fair wind.&rdquo; Upon which a violent storm
suddenly arose, the ship became unmanageable, struck on a rock, and
went down. All on board, with the exception of the pilot, were drowned.
Above the roar of the winds and waves the eager watchers from the
shore, who were waiting for the arrival of the vessel with her precious
freight, could hear the solemn tolling of their bells. And still before
a gale their warning chimes sound from their ocean bed, but woe to the
unhappy ship&rsquo;s crew that hears them, for wreck, misfortunes, and
deaths are sure to follow. The following proverb would seem to infer
that Boscastle, as well as no bells, has no market: &ldquo;All play and
no play, like Boscastle Market, which begins at twelve o&rsquo;clock
and ends at noon.&rdquo; Mevagissey church, on the opposite coast, has
neither tower nor bells, and there is a standing joke against its
people that they sold their bells to pay the cost of pulling down the
tower.</p>
<p>Gorran men, who live in an adjoining parish, seem in former days to
have been rivals to the famous &ldquo;Wise men of Gotham,&rdquo; from
the absurd deeds attributed to them, such as &ldquo;Trying to throw the
moon over the cliffs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Building a hedge to keep in the
moonlight,&rdquo; &amp;c. The inhabitants of more than one parish in
Cornwall are said &ldquo;to have built a hedge to keep in the
&lsquo;guckaw&rsquo; (cuckoo).&rdquo; In fact, of nearly all the
parishes in the county some joke is current in the neighbouring
villages.</p>
<p>Not far from Boscastle is the beautiful waterfall of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Nighton&rsquo;s Kieve, and close by are the ruins of
a cottage, once the habitation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108"
href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>of two ladies, who took
possession of it at night. They evidently had seen better days, but
their names and from whence they came remain a mystery, as from the
date of their arrival they held no communication with the outer world.
They kept no servant, and from the villagers bought for themselves the
necessaries of life, asking but few questions, and not answering any.
At first they took long solitary walks in the most secluded spots of
the district; when met they were rarely conversing, and never spoke to
a stranger. These walks were gradually discontinued, and one day a
rumour spread through the village that one of the poor ladies was dead.
Tradition says that the neighbours found the other weeping silent tears
by the side of the corpse. After the funeral the survivor daily grew
more infirm and but rarely left the house, and one morning soon after,
no smoke issuing from the chimneys of the cottage, the villagers peeped
in through the uncurtained windows and saw her sitting dead in her
chair. The friends were buried in one grave, and their secret died with
them.</p>
<p>In Wellcombe church, near Morwenstow, against the font in the north
wall is a door called the &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; opened at
baptisms at the Renunciation, that the devil, which is then supposed to
come out of the child, may be able to get away.</p>
<p>Trecarrel, in East Cornwall, formerly belonged to the Trecarrels,
the last of whom built Launceston church. A singular story has been
handed down from the sixth century of the birth and death of his only
son. His father is described as having been very learned in philosophy,
astrology, astronomy, and other sciences; and it is said that, having
surveyed the planetary orbs just as his child was about to be brought
into the world, he perceived that the time was unfavourable to its
birth, and foreboded a speedy and accidental death to the child.
Overcome with these gloomy ideas he hastened to the house, and
requested the midwife to delay the birth (if it were possible) for one
hour; but nature, conspiring with fate on the downfall of his house,
turned a deaf ear to his entreaties, and a son was born, to the great
joy of all present except to him who was the most interested in the
event. The child, however, grew up in a very promising way, until a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>servant-maid, having placed him to stand near a
bowl of water in order to wash him, chanced to have forgotten the
towel, and having stepped into another room to procure one, on her
return found the boy dead, having fallen into the water with his head
foremost: and in consequence of this unfortunate event the father spent
a large part of his large property in charitable purposes, and in
building and repairing churches in the county of Cornwall.&mdash;J. C.
Gilbert.</p>
<p>A story of a similar nature is related of one of the Arundells, of
whom it had been foretold &ldquo;that he should die in the
sands.&rdquo; To prevent this he left his house of Efford, near
Stratton, and took up his abode at Trerice, another of his estates,
about three-and-a-half miles from Newquay. But the Earl of Oxford,
having surprised and taken <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael&rsquo;s Mount, Sir John Arundell, who was then sheriff of
Cornwall, marched there to besiege and retake it for the king, Edward
IV. Here his fate overtook him, for in a skirmish on Marazion sands he
lost his life, and was buried in the chapel at the Mount. A funeral
procession goes through Stratton before the death of the Bathes of
Kilkhampton.</p>
<p>Between Stratton and the village of Marham, about half-a-mile from
the former town, in the orchard of Binamy farm-house, is an old
quadrangular moat, all that remains to show where stood the castle of
the Blanchminsters, an old family now, I believe, extinct in this
neighbourhood. Of one of them, who lived in the reign of Edward I. and
went with him on a crusade, folk-lore still tells some strange
but&mdash;through the lapse of time&mdash;vague tales. His name was
Ranulph de Blanchminster, corrupted by the country people into old
Blowmanger, and it is said that after he had been absent for two or
three years in the Holy Land, his wife, I suppose thinking that he was
dead, married another baron. On his return he shut himself up alone in
his castle, with the drawbridge generally raised to keep off intruders.
No one was with him when he died; but after his death a will was found
leaving the greater part of his property for the benefit of the poor of
the parish of Stratton. His effigy may be seen in the church, in the
habit of a Crusader, grasping a sword, with his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>feet
resting on the back of a lion. Through his interest Stratton had the
charter of its market. His spirit haunts Binamy grounds (avoided after
dark by the superstitious) in the form of a hare, which always starts
out of the moat and manages to elude the dogs.</p>
<p>Of the doings of the famous Grenvilles of Stow,&mdash;Sir Beville,
the brave Royalist leader, who lost his life at the battle of Lansdowne
in 1643,&mdash;Admiral Sir Richard, immortalized by Tennyson in his
ballad &ldquo;The Revenge,&rdquo;&mdash;and of his son, Sir John, who
served under Sir Walter Raleigh and died at sea,&mdash;I shall say
nothing, these noted men belonging more to history than folk-lore.</p>
<p>Under the same head, too, may be classed the Cornish female
Whittington, Thomasine Bonaventure, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mary Wike (now Week <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary), who lived in
the fourteenth century; the daughter of a labourer, she herself was a
shepherdess. A London merchant, when travelling in Cornwall, lost
himself on our moors, and accidentally met her with her sheep. He asked
of her the way, and was so much struck by her good looks and
intelligence that he begged her from her parents and took her back with
him to be a servant to his wife. In her new situation she conducted
herself with so much propriety that on his wife&rsquo;s death he
courted and married her. Soon after he himself died, and left her a
wealthy widow. Her next marriage was to a much richer man, named Henry
Gall. Widowed a second time, and again inheriting her husband&rsquo;s
money, she took for her third and last husband Sir John Percival, Lord
Mayor of London. Him, too, she outlived, and after his death returned
to her native village, where she employed her great riches in works of
charity. Amongst her other good deeds she founded and endowed a chantry
there, together with a free school, and lodgings for masters, scholars,
and officers.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. S. Hawker, in his book
before-quoted, has a legend which he calls &ldquo;The first Cornish
Mole. A Morality.&rdquo; I, however, suspect it to be a pure invention
of this author; but as it is very pretty, I will give the substance of
it. Alice of the Coombe was a very beautiful, but proud and vain,
damsel; the only child of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>her widowed mother, with whom she
dwelt at Morwenstow. It chanced one day that they, with all the
neighbouring gentry, had been bidden to a grand banquet at Stow; and,
as she had set her love on the great and noble Sir Beville Grenville,
its owner, Alice, to win his affections, dressed herself in her richest
robe&mdash;&ldquo;a woven velvet, glossy and soft&rdquo;&mdash;and put
on her fairest jewellery. Her mother, when she saw her thus attired,
struck by her exceeding grace and beauty, said, &ldquo;Often shall I
pray to-night that the Grenville heart may yield. Aye, thy victory
shall be my prayer.&rdquo; The haughty maiden replied, &ldquo;With the
eyes I now see in that glass, and with this vesture, meet for a queen,
I lack no trusting prayer.&rdquo; At this a sudden cry was heard, and
the damsel disappeared from their sight for ever. Shortly after, the
Coombe gardener discovered in the garden a small, unknown hillock, and
on top of it shone a ring, which was recognized as the one the lady
wore on the day she vanished. A close examination showed that an old
Cornish couplet was now traced on it, which the parish priest
interpreted to mean&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The earth must hide</p>
<p class="line">Both eyes with pride.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As he uttered these words a low cry was heard at his
feet, and there &ldquo;They beheld, O wondrous and strange! a small
dark creature, clothed in a soft velvet skin, in texture and in hue
like the robe of Lady Alice, and they saw as it groped into the earth
that it moved along without eyes in everlasting night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She, herself had become</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">THE FIRST MOLE</p>
<p class="line">OF THE HILLOCKS OF CORNWALL.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Before finishing this section of my work I must say a
few words about the Islands of Scilly and their legends. The
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> H. J. Whitfield, <abbr title=
"Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr>, in 1852, published a book on this
subject, but his legends are for the most part purely fictitious, and
its title, <i>Scilly and its Legends</i>, a little misleading.</p>
<p>The Scilly Isles, just off the Land&rsquo;s End, are very numerous,
but only five are inhabited; some are mere rocks in the sea, and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>counting those, they are said to be a hundred
and fifty. The largest is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s,
and the dwellers on it are apt to look with contempt on the inhabitants
of the other islands (the Off Islands). The word Scilly is sometimes
derived from Sull&egrave;h, rocks dedicated to the sun, and sometimes
from Sillyas, a conger. This fish is very plentiful on these coasts,
and a ridiculous rhyme says that Scilly fare consists of&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Scads and &lsquo;tates, scads and
&rsquo;tates,</p>
<p class="line">Scads, and &rsquo;tates, and conger,</p>
<p class="line">And those who can&rsquo;t eat scads and
&rsquo;tates&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Oh, they must die of hunger.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Occasionally the saying runs: &ldquo;Oh! the
Scillonians live on fish and &rsquo;taties every day, and conger-pie
for Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the beginning of this century, before steam-boats were invented,
when communication between Scilly and Penzance (the mainland) depended
upon wind and weather, in winter its people were often reduced to great
straits for want of provisions, which gave rise to the proverb,
&ldquo;There is always a feast or a fast in Scilly.&rdquo; This is,
however, now far from being the truth, and it is one of the most
prosperous parts of Great Britain; its inhabitants, as a rule, are well
educated, they are noted for their courteous manners; and for its
beautiful scenery Scilly is well worth a visit. The dialect of its
poorer people, as also the tones of their voices (each island has its
peculiarity), differ from those of the same class in West Cornwall.
Their pronunciation rather resembles the Irish. <i>Thread</i> with them
is <i>tread</i>, the <i>th</i> at the beginning of words being rarely
sounded, <i>pint</i> is <i>point</i>, and <i>point pint</i>.</p>
<p>Irreverent people declare that when Ireland was made some little
bits of earth fell from the shovel and formed Scilly. Certain it is
that when <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick drove out all venomous
reptiles from the former place he did the same kind service to the
latter. The island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes was
particularly favoured, for until recently there was not a rat on it,
they were introduced from a wrecked vessel.</p>
<p>Small as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s is (about three
miles long and nine around) it boasts of two capitals; the modern one
dates from the time of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>Queen Elizabeth, and is called
Hugh Town; before that Old Town was the principal village. At the east
of Old Town Bay is Tolman Point (a corruption, I suppose, of T&ocirc;l
M&ecirc;n, the holed stone). Of it an old legend says when Scilly was
under the monks of Tavistock, and Old Town the only port of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s, that they drew a chain
from &ldquo;Tollman head&rdquo; across the entrance, and levied a toll
from all who embarked and landed there, not excepting the fishermen. It
was abolished by Richard Plantagenet, who, coming disguised to the
port, was not recognized by the friar in charge, who demanded from him
his dues. Upon which Earl Richard, in a fit of passion, struck him dead
at his feet. According to Leland, &ldquo;<span lang="en">Inniscan
longid to Tavestock, and there was a poor celle of monkes of Tavestock.
Sum caulle this Trescau.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a settlement of Benedictine monks here long before the
Norman Conquest; their cell was dedicated to <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas,
as well as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, is the patron saint of
fishermen; the former also takes school-boys under his protection.
Fragments of Tresco Abbey which was then founded still exist. It was
independent until the reign of Edward I., when it was joined to
Tavistock. The same monarch, Edward I., made Ranulph de White Monastery
(supposed to be Ranulph de Blankminster, or Randolph de
Blancheminster), according to an old archive, constable of these
islands, with the castle of Ennor, in Old Town, on his &ldquo;Paying
yearly, at the feast of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael the
Archangel, 300 birds, called puffins, or <abbr title=
"6 shilling 8 pence">6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></abbr>&rdquo; Traces of
these monastic visitors are to be found in a pile of rocks at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s, called Carn Friars (a farm
near by bears the same name), and one of the most highly cultivated and
sheltered spots, where a few trees grow, is known as Holy Vale.
Whitfield places a nunnery there, and says Holy Vale takes <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e3041" title="Source: it">its</span> name from a
miraculous rosebush that grew in it, and that &ldquo;One of its flowers
was deemed to have the power, if worn, to preserve its bearer from
mortal sin,&rdquo; but no other authority mentions it.</p>
<p>Giants, of course, frequently played a great part in the history of
Scilly. Buzza&rsquo;s Hill, just beyond Hugh Town (<abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>commemorates a giant of the
name of Bosow, who made his home on its summit (now crowned by a
Spanish windmill), and from whom the family of Bosow were descended.
One of the finest promontories on the same island is Giant&rsquo;s
Castle&mdash;Troutbeck says, built by the Danes. Here, too, is
Giant&rsquo;s Chair, where the Arch Druid used in former days to sit
and watch the sun rise. Druidical remains are scattered all over the
different islands, and the many &ldquo;barrows&rdquo; are known as
&ldquo;giants&rsquo; graves.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the old abbey gardens at
Tresco is a curious stone, about four feet long, two feet wide, and six
inches in thickness, in an upright position. Near the top are two
holes, one above the other (one being somewhat larger than the other),
through which a man might pass his hand. It is supposed to be an old
Druidical betrothal or wishing-stone, and used before the monks built
the abbey at Tresco. Young people, engaged to be married, would pass
their hands through the holes, and, joining them together, would so
plight their troth. As a wishing-stone, or to break a spell, a ring
would be passed through the holes with some
incantations.&rdquo;&mdash;J. C. Tonkin&rsquo;s <i>Guide to the Isles
of Scilly</i>.</p>
<p>The finest headland on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s
is Peninnis, and some of the sheltered nooks under its rocks have
rather curious names. One of them is known as Sleep&rsquo;s Abode (or
Parlour), and close by is Pitt&rsquo;s Parlour, which commands a lovely
view; it is so called after a Mr. Pitt, who, when on a visit to Scilly,
spent his summer evenings there with a chosen party of friends. An old
lady, a native of Scilly, long since dead, told me that tradition said
Mr. Pitt came to Scilly in consequence of a bet he made with a
gentleman (I believe the then governor of the islands), who, when in
London, spoke in the highest terms of the morality of its women, and
offered to lay a heavy wager that not a single courtesan could be found
there. Mr. Pitt took up the bet, travelled down to Scilly, and for a
long time seemed likely to lose it; but at last, by a large bribe, he
overcame the virtue of one very poor woman, and, in gratitude, allowed
her a small pension until her death.</p>
<p>At the foot of Peninnis is Piper&rsquo;s Hole (in which there is a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>pool of fresh water). This is said to be the
entrance of a subterranean passage leading to the island of Tresco,
where another Piper&rsquo;s Hole is shown as the exit. Old people told
marvellous tales of rash people venturing in so far that they never
returned, but died in it overcome by fatigue&mdash;the passage being
too narrow for them to turn. Also of dogs who disappeared in the hole
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s, and after many days
crept out from the one in Tresco, very emaciated, and almost hairless.
The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> J. W. North, in his <i>Week in
the Isles of Scilly</i>, has an interesting account of Piper&rsquo;s
Hole at Tresco.</p>
<p>Half-way down Giant&rsquo;s Castle, the steep carn before mentioned
on <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s, lies a very
inaccessible cave known as Tom Butt&rsquo;s Bed, from the fact that a
boy of that name hid himself there in Queen Anne&rsquo;s time three
days and three nights out of sight of the press-gang.</p>
<p>The wreck of Sir Cloudesley Shovel in 1707, upon Gilston Rock, in
Porth Hellick Bay, near Old Town, is of course a matter of history.
Very many traditions have, however, gathered around this sad event,
related by many authors. I must briefly retell them, as no book of this
kind would be complete without them.</p>
<p>The admiral, accompanied by the whole of his fleet, was returning
home from Toulon, after the capture of Gibraltar, in his ship the
<i>Association</i>. When they were off Scilly, on October 22nd, 1707,
the weather became thick and dirty, and orders were given &ldquo;to
lie-to.&rdquo; This was in the afternoon. Later on, about six, Sir
Cloudesley again made sail, but two hours after his ship showed signals
of distress, which were answered from several of the others. In two
minutes she struck on the Gilston Rock, sank immediately, and all on
board perished. The <i>Eagle</i> and the <i>Romney</i> with their crews
shared the same fate; the <i>Firebrand</i> also was lost, but her
captain with most of her men were saved. &ldquo;The other men-of-war
with difficulty escaped by having timely notice.&rdquo; In this storm
between fifteen hundred and two thousand people were drowned in one
night.</p>
<p>A day or two before this took place, one man, a native of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>Scilly, is said to have persistently warned the
officer of the watch on board the <i>Association</i> that unless their
ship&rsquo;s course was altered she, with all the fleet, would soon be
on the Scilly rocks amongst the breakers. These warnings so exasperated
the officer that he repeated them to his admiral, and he, vexed that a
common sailor should think that he knew better than his superiors how
to navigate a vessel, summarily ordered him to be hanged at the
yard-arm for inciting the others to insubordination and mutiny. The man
before his execution begged, as a great favour, that the chaplain
should be allowed to read him one of the Psalms. His request was
granted, and he chose the 109th, repeating after the reader in a loud
voice all the curses it contains. And with his last breath he
prophesied that the admiral, with those who saw him hanged, would find
a watery grave. Up to that time the weather had been fair, but as soon
as his body had been committed to the sea it changed, the wind began to
blow, and his shipmates were horrified to see the corpse out of its
winding-sheet, face up, following in their wake, and even before their
vessel struck they gave themselves up for lost men. Some say that Sir
Cloudesley&rsquo;s body came ashore on a hatch, on which he had
endeavoured to save himself, with his favourite little dog dead by his
side. Others, that after the wreck it was cast naked on Porth Hellick
beach, where it was discovered by a soldier, who took off his ring
which he still wore, and buried him in the sands.</p>
<p>Another account, on the authority of Robert, second Lord Romney, Sir
Cloudesley Shovel&rsquo;s grandson, runs thus:&mdash;&ldquo;There is
one circumstance relating to Sir Cloudesley Shovel&rsquo;s death that
is known to very few persons, namely, he was <i>not</i> drowned, having
got to shore, where, by the confession of an ancient woman, he was put
to death. This, many years after, when on her death-bed, she revealed
to the minister of the parish, declaring she could not die in peace
until she had made this confession, as she was led to commit this
horrid deed for the sake of plunder. She acknowledged having, among
other things, an emerald ring in her possession, which she had been
afraid to sell lest it should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117"
href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>lead to a discovery. This
ring, which she delivered to the minister, was by him given to James,
Earl of Berkeley, at his particular request, Sir Cloudesley Shovel and
himself having lived on the strictest footing of friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the place and manner of his burial all traditions agree. Where he
lay is still pointed out&mdash;a bare spot surrounded by green grass.
And the Scillonians will tell you that, because he so obstinately
refused to hear a warning, and wantonly threw away so many lives, God,
to keep alive the memory of this great wickedness, permits nothing to
grow on his grave.</p>
<p>Another legend has it that the man who gave the warning escaped
death, as the storm suddenly arose whilst the Psalm was being read,
before the order for his execution could be carried out, and that he
was the only person on board the <i>Association</i> who was not
drowned.</p>
<p>When Lady Cloudesley Shovel heard of the wreck, she asked that a
search might be made for her husband&rsquo;s body. A soldier showed a
ring which he had in his possession, which was immediately recognised
as Sir Cloudesley Shovel&rsquo;s. The body was dug up and identified by
the marks of his wounds. The ring was forwarded to his wife, and she,
in gratitude for the soldier&rsquo;s kindness in giving her husband a
decent burial, rewarded him with a pension for life. Sir
Cloudesley&rsquo;s body was embalmed, first taken to Plymouth by sea,
where for some time it lay in state, and finally to London, where it
was interred in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>The abbey at Tresco, formerly under the jurisdiction of the monks of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3122src" href="#xd25e3122" name="xd25e3122src">13</a> at
Tavistock, has been already mentioned. The abbey house, built on its
site, is the seat of Mr. Dorrien Smith (the Proprietor, as the
Scillonians call him). The gardens that surround it are very beautiful,
and famed for the tropical plants that here grow out of doors. There is
an anecdote related of one of the inhabitants of Tresco, who, when
asked what they did for firewood in a spot where no trees grew,
answered, &ldquo;We kindle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>our fires from the loppings of our
geranium hedges.&rdquo; Tresco, like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Levan, at the Land&rsquo;s End, was in bygone days the favourite haunt
of witches. A poor man there walking out at nightfall had the
misfortune to meet with a party of them taking a moonlight ride on
their broomsticks. A relation of his was one of the number, and she
warned him, in a stentorian voice, that if he ever mentioned what he
had accidentally seen, he should bear the marks of their wrath until
his dying day. For a long time the secret weighed heavily upon him, and
at last he could not refrain from telling his wife. The witches, in
revenge, turned his black hair white in a single night.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> H. G. Whitfield, in his
<i>Legends of Scilly</i>, gives some marvellous tales of the family of
&ldquo;Dick the Wicked.&rdquo; They were all hardened wreckers, who
generations ago lived on this island, and who also had the gift of
second sight. Dick himself, according to this writer, when ill and
unrepentant, was, by Satanic agency, taken out of his bed and borne,
wrapt in a long loose coat, which he was in the habit of wearing, some
considerable distance from his house. Here his friends discovered him
on the following morning.</p>
<p>On this island stands Cromwell&rsquo;s castle, built during his
Protectorate. Old people thought that he in person visited it. The
large china tankard, out of which he was said to have drunk his
breakfast-beer, still exists. On a hill above are the ruins of
Charles&rsquo;s castle. Scilly always remained loyal and true to the
unfortunate monarch, and this verse of a ballad told me by a Scillonian
was not written of one of them:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In Cromwell&rsquo;s days I was for him,</p>
<p class="line">But now, my boys, I&rsquo;m for the king;</p>
<p class="line">For I can turn, boys, with the tide,</p>
<p class="line">And wear my coat on the strongest side.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Warna, who presided
over wrecks, was the patron saint of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Agnes, another of the principal islands. She crossed over here from
Ireland in a wicker-boat covered with hides, and landed at <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Warna&rsquo;s bay. Like many other saints she had
her holy-well; and often the superstitious inhabitants of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes (five <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>families in all), who enjoyed
the reputation of being the most daring and unscrupulous amongst the
Scilly wreckers of those days, threw crooked pins into it, and daily
invoked and prayed her to send them &ldquo;a rich wreck.&rdquo; There
was no church on it then, and its people rarely visited the other
islands. But it chanced one fine morning the entire population started
in their boats for the church of Ennor, in <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Old Town, as two of them wished to be married.
After the ceremony was over the clergyman in the presence of most of
his parishioners, who had assembled to witness it (between whom and the
men of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes there was always a bitter
feud), rebuked them for their lawless deeds. They, angry at being put
to shame before their enemies, answered with many profane and mocking
words, and were with difficulty restrained from coming to blows. So
incensed were they that they took no notice of the signs which heralded
a coming storm, and hastily got on board their boats to return to their
own home, which none of them were ever destined to reach, as it broke
with great fury when they were about half-way across. When close to
land and the rowers were straining every nerve to get there, one wave
larger than the rest broke over them, and every soul found a watery
grave. This was of course said to be a judgment on them for their
wicked ways. (Leland briefly chronicles it.) From that time
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Warna&rsquo;s well was neglected; there
was no one left the day after twelfth-day, as had been the custom, to
clean it out and return her thanks for her bounty: it gradually got
filled with stones, and at the present day is little more than a
hole.</p>
<p>There is a curious labyrinth on this island called
&ldquo;Troy-town,&rdquo; which it is popularly supposed to represent;
but all intricate places in Cornwall are so denominated, and I have
even heard nurses say to children when they were surrounded by a litter
of toys that they looked as if they were in Troy-town.</p>
<p>A peculiar mode of punishment was formerly practised in Scilly. The
offenders were placed in a chair called a &ldquo;ducking chair,&rdquo;
and publicly at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary&rsquo;s quay-head
&ldquo;ducked&rdquo; in the salt water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="xd25e3186"><span class="xd25e3186init">T</span>he fairies of
Cornwall may be divided into four classes, the Small People, the Pixies
(pronounced Piskies or or Pisgies), the Spriggans, and the Knockers.
The first are harmless <span class="corr" id="xd25e3188" title=
"Source: elfiish">elfish</span> little beings known all over England,
whose revels on fine summer nights have often been described by those
favoured individuals who have accidentally had the privilege of seeing
them. As a rule they, however, wish to think themselves invisible, and
in this county it is considered unlucky to call them by the name of
fairies. The stories told about them by our old folk differed but
slightly from those related elsewhere. There was the well-known cow
that gave the finest yield of milk, and retained it all the year round
when others of the herd ran dry, but always ceased the flow at a
certain time, and if efforts were made to draw more from her, kicked
over the the milking-pail. The milkmaid discovered that the cow
belonged to the small people, by reason of her wearing in her hat a
bunch of flowers having in it a four-leaved clover, which rendered them
visible, when she saw them climbing up the cow&rsquo;s legs and sucking
at her teats. The greedy mistress, when the maid told her of this
discovery, contrary to advice, washed the poor animal all over with
salt water, which fairies particularly dislike (as well as the smell of
fish and grease), in order to drive them away. Of course she succeeded
in her object, and by so doing brought <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>nothing but ill-luck
for ever after on herself and family. When unmolested, fairies bring
good fortune to places they frequent; but they are spiteful if
interfered with, and delight in vexing and thwarting people who meddle
with them. It is well known &ldquo;that they can&rsquo;t abear those
whom they can&rsquo;t abide.&rdquo; Then there were the tales of
persons spirited away to fairyland, to wait upon the small
people&rsquo;s children and perform various little domestic offices,
where the time has passed so pleasantly that they have forgotten all
about their homes and relations, until by doing a forbidden thing they
have incurred their master&rsquo;s anger. They were then punished by
being thrown into a deep sleep, and on awakening found themselves on
some moor close to their native villages. These unhappy creatures
never, after their return, settled down to work, but roamed about
aimlessly doing nothing, hoping and longing one day to be allowed to go
back to the place from whence they had been banished. They had first
put themselves into the fairies&rsquo; power by eating or drinking
something on the sly, when they had surprised them at one of their
moonlight frolics; or by accepting a gift of fruit from the hands of
one of these little beings. There are also two or three legends of
curious women, who by underhand dealings have got hold of a mysterious
box of green ointment belonging to the fairies, which, rubbed on the
eyes, gave them the power of seeing them by daylight, when they look
old, withered, and grey, and hate to be spied upon by mortals. These
women are always interrupted when they have put the ointment on one eye
before they have time to anoint both, and by an inadvertent speech they
invariably betray their ill-gotten knowledge. They cannot resist making
an exclamation when they see a fairy pilfering or up to some
mischievous trick. Neither can they keep the secret of the side on
which they see, and they are quickly made to pay the penalty of their
misdeeds by a well-directed blow from the elf&rsquo;s fist, which
deprives them of the sight of that eye for ever. All these old
wives&rsquo; tales are fully related by Mr. Bottrell in his three
series of <i>Traditions, &amp;c., of West Cornwall</i>.</p>
<p>Fairies haunt the ancient monuments of this county, and are supposed
to be the beings who bring ill-luck on the destroyers of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>them. &ldquo;Not long ago a woman of Moushal (a
village near Penzance) told me that troops of small people, not more
than a foot-and-a-half high, used, on moonlight nights, to come out of
a hole in the cliff, opening on to the beach, Newlyn side of the
village, and but a short distance from it. The little people were
always dressed very smart, and if anyone came near them would scamper
away into the hole. Mothers often told their children that if they went
under cliffs by night the small people would carry them away into
&lsquo;Dicky Danjy&rsquo;s
hole.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
<p>These small people are said to have been half-witted people who had
committed no mortal sin, but who, when they died, were not good enough
to go to Heaven. They are always thought, in some state, to have lived
before.</p>
<p>The small people go about in parties, but pisky in his habits, at
least in West Cornwall, is a solitary little being. I gather however,
from Mr. T. Q. Couch&rsquo;s <i>History of Polperro</i> that in the
eastern part of the county the name of Pisky is applied
indiscriminately to both tribes. He says two only of them are known by
name, and quotes the following rhyme:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Jack o&rsquo; the lantern! Joan the wad,</p>
<p class="line">Who tickled the maid and made her mad;</p>
<p class="line">Light me home, the weather&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here in the west he is a ragged merry little fellow
(to laugh like a pisky is a common Cornish simile), interesting himself
in human affairs, threshing the farmer&rsquo;s corn at nights, or doing
other work, and pinching the maidservants when they leave a house dirty
at bed-time. Margery Daw, in our version of the nursery-song, meets
with punishment at his hands for her misdoings&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;See saw, Margery Daw,</p>
<p class="line">Sold her bed and lay upon straw;</p>
<p class="line">Sold her bed and lay upon hay,</p>
<p class="line">And pisky came and carried her away.</p>
<p class="line">For wasn&rsquo;t she a dirty slut</p>
<p class="line">To sell her bed and lie in the dirt?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Should the happy possessor of one of these
industrious, unpaid fairy servants (who never object to taking food
left for them by friends) express his thanks aloud, thus showing that
he sees him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>or try to reward him for his services by giving
him a new suit of clothes, he leaves the house never to return, and in
the latter case may be heard to say:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Pisky fine, pisky gay!</p>
<p class="line">Pisky now will fly away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Or in another version:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Pisky new coat, and pisky new hood,</p>
<p class="line">Pisky now will do no more
good.&rdquo;&mdash;(T.Q.C.)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Mr. Cornish, the Town Clerk of Penzance, mentioned at
an antiquarian meeting recently held in that town, &ldquo;that there
was a brownie still existing in it; that a gentleman, whose opinion he
would take on many matters, had told him that he had often seen it
sitting quietly by the fireside.&rdquo; When mischievously inclined
pisky often leads benighted people a sad dance; like Will of the Wisp,
he takes them over hedges and ditches, and sometimes round and round
the same field, from which they in vain try to find their way home
(although they can always see the path close at hand), until they sit
down and turn their stockings the wrong side out, as an old lady, born
in the last century, whom I well knew, once told me she had done. To
turn a pocket inside out has the same effect. But to quote the words of
a late witty Cornish doctor, &ldquo;Pisky led is often whiskey
led.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. T. Q. Couch in his before-mentioned book has two or three
amusing stories of their merry pranks. One is called &ldquo;A Voyage
with the Piskies.&rdquo; A Polperro lad meeting them one night as he
was going on an errand heard them say in chorus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for
Portallow Green&rdquo; (a place in the neighbourhood). Repeating the
cry after them, &ldquo;quick as thought he found himself there
surrounded by a throng of laughing piskies.&rdquo; The next place they
visited was Seaton Beach, between Polperro and Plymouth; the third and
last cry was &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for the King of France&rsquo;s
cellar.&rdquo; Again he decided on joining them, dropped the bundle he
was carrying on the sands, and &ldquo;immediately found himself in a
spacious cellar, engaged with his mysterious companions in tasting the
richest wines.&rdquo; Afterwards they strolled through the palace,
where in a room he saw all the preparations made for a feast,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>and could not resist the temptation of pocketing
one of the rich silver goblets from the table. The signal for their
return was soon given, and once more he found himself on Seaton Beach,
where he had just time to pick up his bundle before he was whisked
home. All these voyages were made in the short space of five minutes.
When on his return he told his adventures they were listened to with
incredulity until he produced the goblet, which proved the truth of his
tale. After having been kept for generations this trophy has
disappeared. &ldquo;These little creatures seem sometimes,&rdquo; Mr.
Couch says, &ldquo;to have delighted in mischief for its own sake. Old
Robin Hicks, who formerly lived in a house at &lsquo;Quay Head&rsquo;
(Polperro), has more than once, on stormy winter nights, been alarmed
at his supper by a voice sharp and shrill&mdash;&lsquo;Robin! Robin!
your boat is adrift.&rsquo; Loud was the laughter and the
<i>tacking</i> of hands (clapping) when they succeeded in luring Robin
as far as the quay, where the boat was lying safely at its
moorings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of his legends is about a fisherman of his district, John
Taprail, long since dead, who was, on a frosty night, aroused from his
sleep by a voice which called to him that his boat was in danger. He
went down to the beach to find that some person had played a practical
joke on him. As he was returning he saw a group of piskies sitting in a
semicircle under a much larger boat belonging to one of his neighbours.
They were dividing a heap of money between them by throwing a piece of
gold alternately into each of the hats which lay before them. John was
covetous, and forgot that piskies hate to be spied upon; so he crept up
and pushed his hat slily in with the others. When the pile was getting
low he tried to get off with his booty without their detecting the
fraud. He had got some distance before the cheat was discovered; then
they pursued him in such hot haste that he only escaped with his
treasure by leaving his coat-tails in their hands. &ldquo;The
pisky&rsquo;s midwife&rdquo; is common,&mdash;a mortal who has been
decoyed into fairyland discovers it by accidentally rubbing her eye
with a bit of soap whilst washing the baby. Like those who have stolen
and applied the green ointment, she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>loses the sight of it
by a blow from an angry pisky&rsquo;s fist. She meets and recognizes
the father at a fair where, as usual, he is pilfering, and foolishly
asks after the welfare of mother and child. But all these stories in
West Cornwall would be told of the &ldquo;small people,&rdquo; as well
as the well-known &ldquo;Colman Grey&rdquo; (of course the name
varies), which relates how a farmer one day found a poor, half-starved
looking bantling, sitting alone in the middle of a field, whom he took
home and fed until he grew quite strong and lively. A short time after
a shrill voice was suddenly heard calling thrice upon &ldquo;Colman
Grey.&rdquo; Upon which the imp cried &ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! my daddy is
come!&rdquo; flew through the keyhole, and was never heard of after.
Unbaptised children were, in this county at the beginning of the
century, said to turn, when they died, into piskies; they gradually
went through many transformations at each change, getting smaller until
at last they became &ldquo;Meryons&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3259src" href="#xd25e3259" name="xd25e3259src">1</a> (ants) and
finally disappeared. Another tradition is that they were Druids, who,
because they would not believe in Christ, were for their sins condemned
to change first into piskies; gradually getting smaller, they too, as
ants, at last are lost. It is on account of these legends considered
unlucky to destroy an ant&rsquo;s nest, and a piece of tin put into one
could, in bygone days, through pisky power be transmuted into silver,
provided that it was inserted at some varying lucky moment about the
time of the new moon.</p>
<p>Moths were formerly believed in Cornwall to be departed souls, and
are still, in some districts, called piskies.</p>
<p>There is also a green bug which infests bramble-bushes in the late
autumn that bears the same name, and one of the reasons assigned for
blackberries not being good after Michaelmas is that pisky spoils them
then. Pisky is in some places invoked for luck at the swarming of
bees.</p>
<p>It was once a common custom in East Cornwall, when houses were
built, to leave holes in the walls by which these little beings could
enter; to stop them up would drive away good luck. And in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>West
Cornwall knobs of lead, known as pisky&rsquo;s paws or pisky feet, were
placed at intervals on the roofs of farm-houses to prevent the piskies
from dancing on them and turning the milk sour in the dairies.</p>
<p>Country people in East Cornwall sometimes put a prayer book under a
child&rsquo;s pillow as a charm to keep away piskies. I am told that a
poor woman, near Launceston, was fully persuaded that one of her
children was taken away and a pisky substituted, the disaster being
caused by the absence of a prayer book on one particular
night.&mdash;<abbr>H. G. T.</abbr>, <i>Notes and Queries</i>, December,
1850.</p>
<p>Small round stones, known as &ldquo;Pisky Grinding Stones,&rdquo;
are occasionally found in Cornwall; they are most probably parts of old
spindles.</p>
<p>If piskies are kind and helpful little beings, spriggans or sprites
are spiteful creatures, never doing a good turn for anyone. It is they
who carry off poor babies from their mothers, when they have been
obliged to leave them for a few hours alone, putting their own ugly,
peevish brats in their cradles, who never thrive under the
foster-mother&rsquo;s care, in spite of all the trouble they may bestow
upon them. Mr. Bottrell tells the story of a spriggan, a married man
with a family, who took the place of a poor woman&rsquo;s child one
evening when she was at work in the harvest field. For although an
innocent baby held in the arms is thought in Cornwall to protect the
holder from mischief caused by ghosts and witches, it has no power over
these creatures, who are not supposed to have souls. The scene of this
legend was under Chapel Carn Brea, on the old road from Penzance to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just in Penwith. The mother, Jenny
Trayer by name, was first alarmed on her return one night from her work
in the harvest field by not finding her child in its cradle, but in a
corner of the kitchen where in olden days the wood and furze for the
then general open fires were kept. She was however too tired to take
much notice, and went to bed, and slept soundly until the morning. From
that time forth she had no peace; the child was never satisfied but
when eating or drinking, or when she had it dandling in her arms. The
poor woman consulted her neighbours in turn as to what she should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>do with the changeling (as one and all agreed
that it was). One recommended her to dip it on the three first
Wednesdays in May in Chapel Uny Well,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3290src" href="#xd25e3290" name="xd25e3290src">2</a> which advice
was twice faithfully carried out in the prescribed manner. The third
Wednesday was very wet and windy, but Jenny determined to persevere in
this treatment of her ugly bantling, and holding the brat (who seemed
to enjoy the storm) firmly on her shoulders, she trudged off. When they
got about half-way, a shrill voice from behind some rocks was heard to
say,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tredrill! Tredrill!</p>
<p class="line">Thy wife and children greet thee well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Not seeing anyone, the woman was of course alarmed,
and her fright increased when the imp made answer in a similar
voice,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;What care I for wife or child,</p>
<p class="line">When I ride on Dowdy&rsquo;s back to the Chapel
Well,</p>
<p class="line">And have got pap my fill?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After this adventure, she took the advice of another
neighbour, who told her the best way to get rid of the spriggan and
have her own child returned was &ldquo;to put the small body upon the
ashes&rsquo; pile, and beat it well with a broom; then lay it naked
under a church stile; there leave it and keep out of sight and hearing
till the turn of night; when nine times out of ten the thing will be
taken away and the stolen child returned.&rdquo; This was finally done;
all the women of the village after it had been put upon a convenient
pile &ldquo;belabouring it with their brooms,&rdquo; upon which it
naturally set up a frightful roar. After dark it was laid under the
stile, and there next morning the woman &ldquo;found her own
&lsquo;dear cheeld&rsquo; sleeping on some dry straw,&rdquo; most
beautifully clean and wrapped in a piece of chintz. &ldquo;Jenny nursed
her recovered child with great care, but there was always something
queer about it, as there always is about one that has been in the
fairies&rsquo; power&mdash;if only for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many other tales of changelings, but they resemble each
other so much that they are not worth relating. In the one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>before quoted from Mr. Bottrell he gives a third
charm for getting a child restored, as follows: &ldquo;Make by night a
smoky fire, with green ferns and dry. When the chimney and house are
full of smoke as one can bear, throw the changeling on the hearthstone;
go out of the house, turn three times round; when one enters, the right
child will be restored.&rdquo; Spriggans, too, guard the vast treasures
that are supposed to be buried beneath our immense carns and in our
cliff castles. No matter if the work be carried on by night or by day,
they are sure to punish the rash person who ventures to dig in hopes of
securing them. When he has got some way down, he finds himself
surrounded by hundreds of ugly beings, in some cases almost as tall as
he, who scare the unhappy man until he loses all control over himself,
throws down his tools, and rushes off as fast as he can <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e3317" title="Source: possiby">possibly</span> go. The
fright often makes him so ill that he has to lie for days in bed.
Should he ever summon up courage to return to the spot, he will find
the pit refilled, and no traces to show that the ground had been
disturbed.</p>
<p>Knockers (pronounced knackers) are mine fairies, popularly supposed
to be (as related elsewhere) the souls of the Jews who crucified
Christ, sent by the Romans to work as slaves in the tin mines. In proof
of this, they are said never to have been heard at work on Saturdays,
nor other Jewish festivals. They are compelled to sing carols at
Christmas time. Small pieces of smelted tin found in old smelting-works
are known as &ldquo;Jews&rsquo; bowels.&rdquo; These fairies haunt none
but the richest tin mines, and many are reputed to have been discovered
by their singing and knocking underground; and miners think when they
hear them that it is a sign of good luck, because when following their
noises they often chance on lodes of good ore. When a miner goes into
an &ldquo;old level&rdquo; and sees a bright light, it is a sure sign
that he will find tin there. Knockers like spriggans are very ugly
beings, and, if you do not treat them in a friendly spirit, very
vindictive. &ldquo;As stiff as Barker&rsquo;s knee&rdquo; is a common
saying in Cornwall; he having in some way angered the knockers, either
by speaking of them disrespectfully or by not leaving (as was formerly
the custom) a bit of his dinner on the ground for them (for good luck),
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>in revenge threw all their tools in his lap,
which lamed him for the rest of his life. Mr. Bottrell tells a similar
story of a man named Tom Trevorrow, who when he was working underground
heard the knockers just before him, and roughly told them &ldquo;to be
quiet and go.&rdquo; Upon which, a shower of stones fell suddenly
around him, and gave him a dreadful fright. He seems however to have
quickly got over it, and soon after, when eating his dinner, a number
of squeaking voices sang,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tom Trevorrow! Tom Trevorrow!</p>
<p class="line">Leave some of thy &lsquo;fuggan&rsquo;<a class=

</div>

<p>Bucca is the name of a spirit that in Cornwall it was once thought
necessary to propitiate. Fishermen left a fish on the sands for bucca,
and in the harvest a piece of bread at lunch-time was thrown over the
left shoulder, and a few drops of beer spilled on the ground for him,
to ensure good luck. Bucca, or bucca-boo, was, until very lately (and I
expect in some places still is) the terror of children, who were often
when crying told &ldquo;that if they did not stop he would come and
carry them off.&rdquo; It was also the name of a ghost; but now-a-days
to call a person a &ldquo;great bucca&rdquo; simply implies that you
think him a fool. There were two buccas&mdash;</p>

Cornish miners, or &ldquo;tinners&rdquo; as they are generally called,
are a very intelligent, and since the days of Wesley a religious body
of men, many of their old-world beliefs still linger. To this day it is
considered unlucky to make the form of a cross on the sides of a mine,
and when underground you may on no account whistle for fear of vexing
the knockers and bringing ill-luck, but you may sing or even
swear<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3375src" href="#xd25e3375" name=
"xd25e3375src">1</a> without producing any bad effect. Down one
mine-shaft a black goat is often seen to descend, but is never met
below; in another mine a white rabbit forebodes an accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The occurrence of a black cat in the lowest depths of a mine
will warn the older miners off that level until the cat is
exterminated.&rdquo;&mdash;Thomas Cornish, <i>Western Antiquary,
October, 1887</i>.</p>
<p>A hand clasping the ladder and coming down with, or after a miner,
foretells misfortune or death. This superstition prevails, also, in the
slate quarries of the eastern part of the county.</p>
<p>The miners in the slate quarries of Delabole have a tradition that
the right hand of a miner, who committed suicide, is sometimes seen
following them down the ladders, grasping the rings as they let them
go, holding a miner&rsquo;s light between the thumb and finger. It
forebodes ill to the seer.&mdash;Esm&egrave; Stuart. See
&ldquo;Tamsin&rsquo;s Choice,&rdquo; <i>Longman</i>, June, 1883.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>Miners, too, had some superstition in regard to snails, known in
Cornwall as &ldquo;bullhorns;&rdquo; for if they met one on their way
to work they always dropped a bit of their dinner or some grease from
their lanthorn before him for good-luck.</p>
<p>Miraculous dreams are related; warnings to some miners, which have
prevented on particular days their going down below with their
comrades, when serious accidents have happened and several have lost
their lives. Rich lodes, too, have been discovered through the dreams
of fortunate women, who have been shown in them where their male
relatives should dig for the hidden treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Dowsing&rsquo; (divining with the rod) is of
course believed in here as elsewhere, and some men are known as noted
&lsquo;dowsers.&rsquo; A forked twig of hazel (also called a
&lsquo;dowser&rsquo;) is used by our Cornish miners to discover a vein
of ore; it is held loosely in the hand, the point towards the
&lsquo;dowser&rsquo;s&rsquo; breast, and it is said to turn round when
the holder is standing over metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miners still observe some quaint old customs; a horse-shoe is
sometimes placed on a convenient part of the machinery, which each, as
he goes down to his day&rsquo;s work, touches four times to ensure
good-luck. These must be &ldquo;Tributers&rdquo; (pronounced
trib-ut-ers), who work on &ldquo;trib-ut,&rdquo; when a percentage is
paid on ores raised; in contradistinction to &ldquo;Tut-workers,&rdquo;
who are paid by the job.</p>
<p>A miner, going underground with shoes on, will drive all the mineral
out of the mine.&mdash;<i>Cornubiana</i>, <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle.</p>
<p>In 1886, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just in Penwith two men
of Wheal Drea had their hats burnt one Monday morning, after the birth
of their first children.</p>
<p>Three hundred fathoms below the ground at Cook&rsquo;s Kitchen mine,
near Camborne, swarms of flies may be heard buzzing, called by the men,
for some unknown reason, &ldquo;Mother Margarets.&rdquo; From being
bred in the dark, they have a great dislike to light.</p>
<p>Swallows in olden times were thought to spend the winter in deep,
old disused Cornish tin-works; also in the sheltered nooks of its
cliffs and cairns. It is the custom here to jump on seeing the first in
spring. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=

<p>A water-wagtail, in Cornwall a &ldquo;tinner,&rdquo; perching on a
window-sill, is the sign of a visit from a stranger.</p>
<p>Carew says&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="en">The Cornish tynners hold a
strong imagination, that in the withdrawing of Noah&rsquo;s floud to
the sea the same took his course from east to west, violently breaking
vp, and forcibly carrying with it the earth, trees, and rocks, which
lay anything loosely neere the vpper face of the ground. To confirme
the likelihood of which supposed truth, they doe many times digge vp
whole and huge timber-trees, which they conceiue at that deluge to haue
been ouerturned and whelmed.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miners frequently in conversation make use of technical proverbs,
such as &ldquo;Capel rides a good horse.&rdquo; Capel is schorl, and
indicates the presence of tin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wise man that knows
tin&rdquo; alludes to the various forms it takes. To an old tune they
sing the words&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

applied to a wound immediately cures it; of which they are so sure that
they use no other remedy than washing it in the water that runs through
the mundic ore.&mdash;<i>A Complete History of Cornwall, 1730.</i></p>
<p>It is an easy transition from mines to fish, the next staple
industry of Cornwall, and to the superstitions of its fishermen and
sailors. Fish is a word in West Cornwall applied more particularly to
pilchards (pelchurs). They frequent our coasts in autumn.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When the corn is in the shock,</p>
<p class="line">Then the fish are on the rock.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And if on a close foggy day in that season you ask the
question,&mdash;&ldquo;Do you think it will rain?&rdquo; the answer
often is&mdash;&ldquo;No! it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133"
href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>only het (heat) and
pelchurs,&rdquo; that sort of weather being favourable for catching
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good year for fleas is a good year for fish,&rdquo; the
proverb says; and when eating a pilchard the flesh must be always taken
off the bone from the tail to the head. To eat them from head to tail
is unlucky, and would soon drive the fish from the shore. There are
many other wise sayings about pilchards; but I will only give one more
couplet, which declares that&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;They are food, money, and light,</p>
<p class="line">All in one night.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">Should pilchards when in bulk<a class="noteref" id=

quickly be in the bay.</p>
<p>Fishermen dread going near the spot where vessels have been wrecked,
as the voices of the drowned often call to them there, especially
before a storm. Sometimes their dead comrades call them by their names,
and then they know for certain that they will soon die; and often when
drowning the ghosts of their friends appear to them. They are seen by
them sometimes taking the form of animals.</p>
<p>Mr. Bottrell speaks of a farmer&rsquo;s wife who was warned of her
son&rsquo;s death by the milk in the pans ranged round her dairy being
agitated like the sea waves in a storm. There is a legend common to
many districts of a wrecker who rushed into the sea and perished, after
a voice had been heard to call thrice, &ldquo;The hour is come, but not
the man.&rdquo; He was carried off by the devil in a phantom ship seen
in the offing. But ships haunted with seamen&rsquo;s ghosts are rarely
lost, as the spirits give the sailors warning of storms and other
dangers.</p>
<p>In a churchyard near the Land&rsquo;s End is the grave of a drowned
captain, covered by a flat tombstone; proceeding from it formerly the
sound of a ghostly bell was often heard to strike four and eight bells.
The tale goes that when his vessel struck on some rocks close to the
shore, the captain saw all his men safely off <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>in
their boat, but refused himself to leave the ship, and went down in her
exactly at midnight, as he was striking the time. His body was
recovered, and given decent burial, but his poor soul had no rest. An
unbelieving sailor once went out of curiosity to try if he could hear
this bell; he did, and soon after sailed on a voyage from which he
never returned.</p>
<p>Spectre ships are seen before wrecks; they are generally shrouded in
mist; but the crew of one was said to consist of two men, a woman, and
a dog. These ships vanish at some well-known point. Jack Harry&rsquo;s
lights, too, herald a storm; they are so called from the man who first
saw them. These appear on a phantom vessel resembling the one that will
be lost.</p>
<p>On boarding a derelict, should a live cat or other animal be found,
it is thrown into the sea and drowned, under the idea that if any
living thing is in her, the finders can claim nothing from the owners.
In fact she is not a derelict.</p>
<p>The apparition of a lady carrying a lanthorn always on one part of
the Cornish coast<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3491src" href="#xd25e3491"
name="xd25e3491src">5</a> foretells a storm and shipwrecks. She is
supposed to be searching for her child who was drowned, whilst she was
saved, because she was afraid to trust it out of her arms. For the
legends of &ldquo;The Lady of the Vow&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Hooper or
Hooter of Sennen Cove,&rdquo; see <i>ante</i>, p. 71.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3499src" href="#xd25e3499" name="xd25e3499src">6</a> Mermaids
are still believed in, and it is very bad to offend them, for by their
spite harbours have been filled up with sand. They, however, kindly
take idiot children under their protection. The lucky finder of one of
their combs or glasses has the power (as long as it remains in his
possession) of charming away diseases.</p>
<p>Boats are said to come to a sudden standstill when over the spot
where lies the body of a drowned man, for whom search is being made.
The body is supposed to rise when drowned, on the seventh, eighth, or
ninth day. Sailors regard many things as bad omens, such &ldquo;as a
loaf of bread turned upside-down on a table.&rdquo; (This will bring
some ship to distress.) They will not begin a voyage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>on
Childermas-day, nor allow a piece of spar-stone (quartz) to be carried
on board a vessel: that would ensure her striking on a rock. Of course,
they neither whistle when there, nor speak of hares, two most unlucky
things; and should they meet one of these animals on their way to the
place of embarkation they think it far wiser to turn back home, and put
off sailing for a tide. Hares (as already noticed) play a great part in
Cornish folk-lore. The following amusing story I had from a
friend:&mdash;&ldquo;Jimmy Treglown, a noted poacher living in a
village of West Cornwall, became converted at a revival meeting; he was
tempted on his way to class-meeting one Sunday morning soon after by
the devil in the form of a beautiful hare. Jimmy said, &lsquo;There
thee art, my dear; but I waan&rsquo;t tooch thee on a Sunday&mdash;nor
yet on a weeky day, for that matter.&rsquo; He went briskly on his way
for a few paces, and then, like Lot&rsquo;s wife, he was tempted to
look behind him. Alas! in Jimmy&rsquo;s own words, &lsquo;There she was
in her seat, looking lovely. I tooked up a stone, and dabbed at her.
Away she runned, and fare-ee well, religion. Mine runned away with her.
I went home, and never went to class no more.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3507src" href="#xd25e3507" name="xd25e3507src">7</a> You see it
was the devil, and &lsquo;simmen to me&rsquo; (seeming) I heard
&rsquo;un laugh and say, &lsquo;Ah! ah! Jimmy, boy, I had thee on the
hip then. Thee must confess thee&rsquo;st had a fair fall.&rsquo; So I
gave in, and never went nigh the &lsquo;people&rsquo; (Wesleyans) no
more. Nobody should fire at hares of this sort, except with a silver
bullet; they often appear as white, but the devil knowed I
couldn&rsquo;t be fooled with a white &rsquo;un.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
Nothing is too ridiculous to be told of hares. Another old man from
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just (still living) once recited this
anecdote in our kitchen, and from his grave manner evidently expected
it to be believed:&mdash;&ldquo;I was out walking (he said) one Sunday
morning, when I saw a hare in a field which I longed to have; so I
shied a bit of &lsquo;codgy wax&rsquo; (cobbler&rsquo;s wax), the only
thing I had in my pocket, at &rsquo;un, when he ran away. What was my
surprise on getting over a stile to see two hares in the next field
face to face, the &lsquo;codgy wax&rsquo; had stuck to the nose of the
first, and he in his fright had runned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>against the other,
and was holden &rsquo;un fast, too. So I quietly broke the necks of
both, and carried em home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grapes are sour&rdquo; is in Cornwall often changed to
&ldquo;Lev-un go! he&rsquo;s dry eaten after all,&rdquo; as the old man
said when he couldn&rsquo;t catch the hare.</p>
<p>Sailors and fishermen have naturally many weather proverbs, of which
I will give a few:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A north wind is a broom for the Channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Saturday&rsquo;s moon is a sailor&rsquo;s curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Saturday&rsquo;s and Sunday&rsquo;s moon<br>
Comes once in seven years too soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between twelve and two you&rsquo;ll see what the day will
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A southerly wind with a fog bring an easterly wind in
&lsquo;snog&rsquo; (with certainty).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday&rsquo;s noon is Sunday&rsquo;s doom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday and the week are never alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a Saturday in the year<br>
But what the sun it doth appear,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weather dogs&rdquo; are pillars of light coloured like the
rainbow, which appear on the horizon generally over the sea in
unsettled weather, and always foretell storms. The inland dwellers of
Cornwall have also their wise sayings on this subject. Rooks darting
around a rookery, sparrows twittering, donkeys braying, are signs of
rain. Cats running wildly about a house are said to bring storms on
their tails. Some of their omens are simply ludicrous, such as
&ldquo;We may look for wet when a cat, in washing its face, puts its
paw over its ear,&rdquo; or when &ldquo;hurlers&rdquo; (small sparks)
play about the bars of a grate. A cock crowing on a stone is a sign of
fine weather; on the doorstep, of a stranger. But here it is well known
&ldquo;That fools are weather-wise,&rdquo; and &ldquo;That those that
are weather-wise are rarely otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In West Cornwall, not very long ago farmers, before they began to
break up a grass field or plough for sowing, always turned the faces of
the cattle attached to the plough towards the west and solemnly said,
&ldquo;In the name of God let us begin,&rdquo; and then with the
sun&rsquo;s course proceeded on their work. Everything in this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>county, even down to such a small thing as
taking the cream off the milk-pans set round the dairy, must for luck
be done from left to right. Invalids, on going out for the first time
after an illness, must walk with, not against, the sun, for fear of a
relapse.</p>
<p>Farmers here are taught that if they wish to thrive they must
&ldquo;rise with the craw (crow), go to bed with the yow (ewe),&rdquo;
not be &ldquo;like Solomon the wise, who was loth to go to bed and loth
to rise,&rdquo; for does not &ldquo;the master&rsquo;s eye make the
mare fat?&rdquo; &ldquo;A February spring,&rdquo; according to one
proverb, &ldquo;is not worth a pin,&rdquo; and another says &ldquo;a
dry east wind raises the spring.&rdquo; Sayings current in other
counties, such as &ldquo;a peck of March dust is worth a king&rsquo;s
ransom,&rdquo; are also quoted, but those I shall not give. There
should be as many frosty mornings in May as in March, for &ldquo;a hot
May makes a fat church-hay.&rdquo; A wet June makes a dry September.
&ldquo;Cornwall will stand a shower every day, and two for
Sundays.&rdquo; There is always a black month before Christmas. The
farmer too is told&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A rainbow in the morn, put your hook in the
corn;</p>
<p class="line">A rainbow in the eve, put your hook in the
sheave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In Cornwall, as well as in Devon, there is an old
prophecy quoted to the effect, that &ldquo;in the latter days there
will be no difference between summer and winter, save in the length of
the days and the greenness of the leaf.&rdquo; It is erroneously
asserted to be in the Bible.&mdash;<i>Cornubiana</i>, <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle, <i>Transactions Penzance Natural
History Society, etc.</i>, 1885&ndash;1886.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Countrymen in Cornwall, if the breeze fail whilst they are
winnowing, whistle to the spriggan, or air spirit, to bring it
back.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Comparative Folk-lore, Cornhill</i>, 1876.</p>
<p>A swarm of bees in May is worth a &ldquo;yow&rdquo; (ewe) and lamb
same day. It is considered lucky in these parts for a stray swarm to
settle near your house; and if you throw a handkerchief over it you may
claim it as your own. To sell them is unlucky; but you may have an
understanding with a purchaser that he will give you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>an
equivalent for your bees. The inside of hives should be rubbed with
&ldquo;scawnsy buds&rdquo; (elderflowers) to prevent a new swarm from
leaving them. Honey should be always taken from the hive on
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day, he being the
patron saint of bees. Of course all the principal events happening in
the families to whom they belonged, in this as in other counties, were
formerly whispered to them, that the bees might not think themselves
neglected, and leave the place in anger. At a recent meeting of the
Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society a gentleman mentioned
that when a boy he had seen thirty hives belonging to Mr. Joshua Fox,
of Tregedna, tied up in crape (an universal practice) because of a
death in the Fox family. Another at the same time said that when, some
years since, the landlady of the &ldquo;First and Last&rdquo; Inn, at
the Land&rsquo;s End, died, the bird-cages and flower-pots were also
tied with crape, to prevent the birds and plants from dying. When
withering, because this has not been done, if the plants be remembered
in time and crape put on the pots, they may revive. Enquiring a short
time ago what had become of a fine maiden-hair fern that we had had for
years, I was told &ldquo;that we had neglected to put it into mourning
when a near relative of our&rsquo;s had died, or to tell it of his
death; and therefore it had gradually pined away.&rdquo; After a death,
pictures, but especially portraits of the deceased, are also supposed
to fade. Snails as well as bees are thought here to bring luck, for
&ldquo;the house is blest where snails do rest.&rdquo; Children on
meeting them in their path, for some reason stamp their feet and
say,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Snail! snail! come out of your hole,</p>
<p class="line">Or I will beat you black as a coal.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Another Cornish farmers&rsquo; superstition is that
&ldquo;ducks won&rsquo;t lay until they have drunk &lsquo;Lide&rsquo;
(March) water;&rdquo; and the wife of one in 1880 declared &ldquo;that
if a goose saw a Lent lily (daffodil) before hatching its goslings it
would, when they came forth, destroy them.&rdquo; Some witty thieves,
many years ago, having stolen twelve geese from a clergyman in the
eastern part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>county, tied twelve pennies and this

<p class="first">Moles in this county are known as &ldquo;wants,&rdquo;
and once in the Land&rsquo;s End district I overtook an old man and
asked him what had made so many hillocks in a field through which we
were passing. His answer was, &ldquo;What you rich people never have in
your houses, &lsquo;wants.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this day in Cornwall, when anything unforeseen happens to our
small farmers, or they have the misfortune to lose by sickness some of
their stock, they still think that they are &ldquo;ill-wished,&rdquo;
and start off (often on long journeys) to consult a
&ldquo;pellar,&rdquo; or wise man, sometimes called &ldquo;a white
witch&rdquo; (which term is here used indiscriminately for persons of
both sexes). The following I had from a dairy-man I know, who about
twelve years ago quarrelled with a domestic servant, a woman living in
a neighbouring house. Soon after, from some reason, two or three of his
cows died; he was quite sure, he told me, that she had
&ldquo;overlooked&rdquo; and &ldquo;ill-wished&rdquo; him. To ease his
mind he had consulted a &ldquo;pellar&rdquo; about the matter, who had
described her accurately to him, and, for payment, removed the
&ldquo;spell&rdquo; (I do not know what rites were used), telling him
to look at his watch and note the hour, as he would find, when he
returned home, that a cow he had left sick would have begun at that
moment to recover (which he says it did). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>The
&ldquo;pellar&rdquo; also added, &ldquo;The woman who has
&lsquo;ill-wished&rsquo; you will be swaddled in fire and lapped in
water;&rdquo; and by a strange coincidence she emigrated soon after,
and was lost in the ill-fated <i>Cospatrick</i>, that was burnt at
sea.</p>
<p>Water from a font is often stolen to sprinkle
&ldquo;ill-wished&rdquo; persons or things.</p>
<p>The two next examples were communicated to me by a friend:
&ldquo;Some twenty-six years ago a farmer in a neighbouring village
(West Cornwall) sustained during one season continual losses from his
cows dying of indigestion, known as &lsquo;loss of cud,&rsquo;
&lsquo;hoven-blown,&rsquo; etc. After consulting an old farrier called
Armstrong he was induced to go to a &lsquo;pellar&rsquo; in Exeter. His
orders were to go home, and, on nearing his farm, he would see an old
woman in a field hoeing turnips, and that she was the party who had
cast the &lsquo;evil eye&rsquo; on him. When he saw her he was to lay
hold of her and accuse her of the crime, then tear off some of her
dress, take it to his farm, and burn it with some of the hair from the
tails of his surviving stock. These directions were fully carried out,
and his bad health (caused by worry) improved, and he lost no more
cows. A spotted clover that grew luxuriantly that summer was no doubt
the cause of the swelling.&rdquo; &ldquo;Another farmer in the same
village eighteen years since lost all his feeding cattle from
pleuro-pneumonia; believing them to be &lsquo;ill-wished&rsquo; by a
woman, he also consulted the Exeter &lsquo;pellar.&rsquo; He brought
home some bottles of elixir, potent against magic, and made an image of
dough, pierced it from the nape of the neck downward, in the line of
the spine, with a very large blanket-pin. In order to make the agonies
of the woman with the &lsquo;evil eye&rsquo; excruciating in the last
degree, dough and pin were then burnt in a fire of hazel and ash. The
cure failed, as anyone acquainted with the disease might have
forecast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides those remedies already mentioned for curing cattle, you may
employ these:&mdash;&ldquo;Take some blood from the sick animal by
wounding him; let the blood fall on some straw carefully held to the
place&mdash;not a drop must be lost; burn the straw; when the
ill-wisher will be irresistibly drawn to the spot; then by violence you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>can compel him to take off the spell.&rdquo; Or,
&ldquo;Bleed one animal to death to save the whole herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A local newspaper, in 1883 (<i>Cornishman</i>), gives the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Superstitions die hard.&mdash;A horse died the
other day on a farm in the neighbourhood of <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Ives. Its carcase was dragged on a Sunday away up to
the granite rock basins and weather-worn bosses of Trecoben hill, and
there burnt, in order to drive away the evil spell, or ill-wishing,
which afflicted the farm where the animal belonged.&rdquo; I, a few
years since, saw a dying cat taken out of a house on a mat, by two
servants, that it might not die inside and bring ill-luck. &ldquo;In
1865 a farmer in Portreath sacrificed a calf, by burning, for the
purpose of removing a disease which had long followed his horses and
cows.&rdquo; And in another case a farmer burnt a living lamb, to save,
as he said, &ldquo;his flock from spells which had been cast on
them.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert Hunt.</p>
<p>The <i>Cornishman</i>, in another paragraph, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Our
Summercourt (East Cornwall) correspondent witnessed an amusing affair
on Thursday morning (April, 1883). Seeing a crowd in the street, he
asked the reason, and found that a young lady was about to perform the
feat of <i>throwing a pig&rsquo;s nose over a house for good luck</i>!
This is how it was done. The lady took the nose of a pig, that was
killed the day before, in her right hand, stood with her back to the
house, and threw the nose over her head, and over the house, into the
back garden. Had she failed in the attempt her luck was supposed to be
bad.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whet your knife on Sunday, you&rsquo;ll skin on
Monday,&rdquo; is a very old Perranuthnoe and <abbr title=
"Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary (West Cornwall) superstition, so that,
however blunt your knife may be, you must use it as it is, lest by
sharpening it you bring ill-luck on the farmer, and he lose a sheep or
bullock.<a id="xd25e3646" name="xd25e3646"></a> Mr. T. Q. Couch,
<i><abbr title="Western Antiquary">W. Antiquary</abbr></i>, 1883, says
of one, &ldquo;He is an old-fashioned man, and, amongst his other
&lsquo;whiddles&rsquo; (whims), keeps a goat amongst his cattle for the
sake of keeping his cows from slipping their calves.&rdquo; Branches of
care (mountain ash) were, in the east of the county, hung over the
cattle in their stalls to prevent their being &ldquo;ill-wished,&rdquo;
also carried in the pocket as a cure and prevention of rheumatism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>&ldquo;Rheumatism will attack the man who
carries a walking stick made of holly.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Cornubiana</i>,
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle.</p>
<p>The belief in witchcraft in West Cornwall is much more general than
most people imagine. Several cases have lately come under my own
notice; one, that of a man-servant in our employ who broke a
blood-vessel, and for a long time was so ill that his life was
despaired of. He was most carefully attended by a Penzance physician,
who came to see him three times a day. But directly that his strength
began to return he asked permission to go to Redruth to consult a
&ldquo;pellar,&rdquo; as he was quite sure that he had been
&ldquo;overlooked&rdquo; and &ldquo;ill-wished.&rdquo; An old Penzance
man, afflicted with rheumatism, who gained his living by selling fruit
in the streets, fancied himself ill-wished. He went to Helston to see a
&ldquo;wiseman&rdquo; residing there, to whom he paid
seven-and-sixpence, with a further promise of five pounds on the
removal of the &ldquo;spell.&rdquo; As he was too poor to pay this
himself a brother agreed to do it for him, but somehow failed to
perform his contract. Now the poor old man thinks that the
pellar&rsquo;s ill-wishes are added to his former pains.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;pellars&rdquo; wore formerly magical rings, with a blue
stone in them, said to have been formed by snakes breathing on
hazel-twigs. Our country-people often searched for these stones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time of an old lady&rsquo;s decease, a little while
ago, on her breast was found a small silk bag containing several
charms, among others a piece of parchment, about three inches square,
having written on one side of it &lsquo;Nalgah&rsquo; (in capital
letters); under this is a pen-and-ink drawing something like a bird
with two pairs of wings, a pair extended and another folded beneath
them. The creature appears to be hovering and at the same time brooding
on a large egg, sustained by one of its legs, whilst it holds a smaller
egg at the extremity of its other leg, which is outstretched and long.
Its head, round and small, is unlike that of a bird. From the rudeness
of the sketch and its faded state it is difficult to trace all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>outlines. Under this singular figure is the word
&lsquo;Tetragrammaton&rsquo; (in capitals); on the reverse in large
letters&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Jehovah.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;Jah, Eloim.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;Shadday.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;Adonay.&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;Have mercy on a poor woman.&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;A pellar of great repute in the neighbourhood tells me that
this is inscribed with two charms, that Nalgah is the figure only. The
Abracadabra is also supplied, the letters arranged in the usual way.
Another potent spell is the rude draft of the planetary signs for the
Sun, Jupiter, and Venus, followed by a cross, pentagram, and a figure
formed by a perpendicular line and a divergent one at each side of it
united at the bottom. Under them is written, &lsquo;Whosoever beareth
these tokens will be fortunate, and need fear no evil.&rsquo; The
charms are folded in a paper on which is usually written, &lsquo;By the
help of the Lord these will do thee good,&rsquo; and inclosed in a
little bag to be worn on the breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People in good health visited these pellars every spring to get
their charms renewed, and bed-ridden people who kept theirs under their
&ldquo;pillow-beres&rdquo; were then visited by the pellar for the same
purpose. &ldquo;Of amulets mention must be made of certain small
crystal balls called &lsquo;kinning stones,&rsquo; held in high esteem
for cure of ailments of the eye. I examined one of these &lsquo;kinning
stones&rsquo; recently, which had been lent to a person with a bad eye,
who on recovering from his ailment had returned it to the owner. It
proved to be a translucent, blueish-white globular crystal, about
one-and-a-quarter inch in diameter; in texture, horny rather than
vitreous; apparently not made of glass, but perhaps of rock crystal;
pierced by a hole containing a boot lace for suspension; having
stri&aelig; running through the substance of the crystal perpendicular
to the hole. It had been for many generations in possession of the
family of the owner, who valued it very highly, <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e3754" title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>but was willing to
lend it to anyone to do good.<span class="corr" id="xd25e3757" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> This kind of amulet is worn around the
neck, the bad eye being struck with the crystal every morning. There
are other &lsquo;kinning stones&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>within reach, but
examples are not common; their virtues are familiar to the people, and
instances are to be met with among the country folk, whose recovery
from a &lsquo;kinning&rsquo; in the eye (&lsquo;kennel,&rsquo; West
Cornwall) is attributed solely to the use of these
charms.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Notes on the Neighbourhood of Brown Willy</i>
(North Cornwall), <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> A. H. Malan,
<abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr></p>
<p>In every small Cornish village in olden times (and the race is not
yet extinct) lived a charmer or &ldquo;white witch.&rdquo; Their powers
were not quite as great as those of a pellar, but they were thoroughly
believed in, and consulted on every occasion for every complaint. They
were not only able to cure diseases, but they could, when offended,
&ldquo;overlook&rdquo; and ill-wish the offender, bringing ill-luck on
him, and also on his family and farm-stock. The seventh son of the
seventh son, or seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, were born
with this gift of charming, and made the most noted pellars; but anyone
might become a witch who touched a Logan rock nine times at midnight.
These Logan rocks are mentioned elsewhere as being in Cornwall their
favourite resorts, and to them they went, it is said, riding on ragwort
stems, instead of the traditional broomsticks.</p>
<p>Or, he might, says another authority, use the following charm:
&ldquo;Go to the chancel of a church to sacrament, hide away the bread
from the hands of the priest, at midnight carry it around the church
from south to north, crossing east three times. The third time a big
toad, open-mouthed, will be met, put the bread in it; as soon as
swallowed he will breathe three times upon the man, and from that time
he will become a witch. Known by five black spots diagonally placed
under the tongue.&rdquo; There is also a strange glare in the eye of a
person who can &ldquo;overlook,&rdquo; and the eyelids are always
red.</p>
<p>Witches could in this country change themselves into toads, as well
as hares. Mr. Robert Hunt relates the story of one who met her death in
that form, and Mr. T. Q. Couch tells the tale of a sailor who was a
&ldquo;witch,&rdquo; who received several injuries whilst in the shape
of that animal. When a very small child, having a &ldquo;kennel&rdquo;
(an ulcer) on my eye, I was unknown to my parents taken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>by
an old servant to a Penzance &ldquo;charmer,&rdquo; who then made a
great deal of money by her profession. All I can remember about it is,
that she breathed on it, made some curious passes with her hands and
muttered some incantation.</p>
<p>About twelve years ago, a woman who lived in the &ldquo;west
country&rdquo; (Land&rsquo;s End district) as well as being a
&ldquo;white witch was a famous knitster,&rdquo; and we amongst others
frequently gave her work. When she brought it back she was treated by
our maids, who lived in great fear of her &ldquo;ill-wishing&rdquo;
them, to the best our kitchen could afford; and many were the
marvellous stories she told me of her power to staunch blood, etc.,
when doctors failed. It was not necessary for her to see the person;
she could cure them sitting by her fireside if they were miles away.
Witches are also consulted about the recovery of stolen property,
which, by casting their spells over the thief, it is still supposed
they can compel him to return.</p>
<p>A part of Launceston Castle is locally known as Witch&rsquo;s Tower,
from the tradition that one was burnt at its foot; no grass grows on
the spot. Another is said to have met with the same fate on a flat
stone close to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell market-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charms are still in use by the simple-minded for thrush,
warts, and various complaints; also for the cure of cattle, when some
evil disposed person has &lsquo;turned a figure upon (<i>i.e.</i>
bewitched) them;&rsquo; and white witches&mdash;those who avert the
evil eye&mdash;have not yet ceased out of the
land.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Notes on the Neighbourhood of Brown Willy</i>
(North Cornwall), <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> A. H. Malan,
<abbr title="Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr></p>
<p>I will give some of their charms culled from various sources, and
remedies for diseases still used in Cornwall:&mdash;Take three burning
sticks from the hearth of the &ldquo;overlooker,&rdquo; make the
patient cross over them three times and then extinguish with water.
Place nine bramble-leaves in a basin of &ldquo;Holy Well&rsquo;s water,
pass each leaf over and from the diseased part, repeating three times
to each leaf. Three virgins came from the east, one brought fire, the
others brought frost. Out fire! In frost! In the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.&rdquo; Or take a stick of burning furze from the
hearth, pass over and above the diseased part, repeating the above
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>nine times. If you can succeed by any means in
drawing blood from the &ldquo;ill-wisher&rdquo; you are certain to
break and remove the spell. Stick pins into an apple or potatoe, carry
it in your pocket, and as it shrivels the &ldquo;ill-wisher&rdquo; will
feel an ache from every pin, but this I fancy does not do the person
&ldquo;overlooked&rdquo; any good. Another authority says, &ldquo;Stick
pins into a bullock&rsquo;s heart, when the &lsquo;ill-wisher&rsquo;
will feel a stab for every one put in, and in self-defence take off the
curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A friend writes, &ldquo;An old man called Uncle Will Jelbart, who
had been with the Duke of Kent in America, and also a very long time in
the Peninsular, about forty years ago lived in West Cornwall; he had a
small pension, and in addition made a good income by charming warts,
wildfire (erysipelas), cataracts, etc. He used to spit three times and
breathe three times on the part affected, muttering, &lsquo;In the name
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost I bid thee begone.&rsquo; For
cataract he pricked the small white &lsquo;dew-snail&rsquo; (slug),
found about four a.m., with a hawthorn spine, and let a drop fall into
the eye; and in the case of skin diseases occasionally supplemented the
charm with an ointment made of the juice extracted from house-leeks and
&lsquo;raw-cream;&rsquo; he sometimes changed the words and repeated
those which with slight variations are known all over
Cornwall&mdash;&lsquo;Three virgins,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crowfoot locally known as the &lsquo;kenning herb&rsquo;
is in some districts used in incantations for curing
&lsquo;kennings&rsquo; or &lsquo;kennels&rsquo; (ulcers in the
eye).</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Three ladies (or virgins) come from the

<p class="first"><span class="corr" id="xd25e3820" title=

etc.</p>
<p>A lady once told me that about forty years ago she was taken to a
&ldquo;charmer,&rdquo; who stood in a Cornish market-place on fixed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>days, to have her warts cured. The remedies for
this childish complaint are very numerous. I once had my forehead
rubbed with a piece of stolen beef, which was then buried in a garden,
to send them away, the idea being that as the beef decayed the warts
would fall off or dwindle gradually. There are two or three other ways
of getting rid of them of a similar kind. Touch each wart with a new
pin, enclose them in a bottle, either bury them in a newly-made grave
of the opposite sex, or at four cross-roads; as the pins rust, the
warts will disappear. Or, touch them with a knot made in a piece of
string (there should be as many knots as there are warts), bury it;
when the rope decays so will the warts. The two next are selfish
remedies. Touch each wart with a pebble, put the stones in a bag, throw
them away, and the finder will get them and they will leave you. Or, in
coming out of church, wish them on some part of another person&rsquo;s
body (or on a tree); they will go from you and appear on him, or on the
spot named. One method employed by professional &ldquo;charmers&rdquo;
is to take two pieces of charred stick from a fire, form them into a
cross and place them on the warts, and repeat one of the formul&aelig;
above quoted. Yet another is to wash the hands in the moon&rsquo;s rays
focussed in a dry metal basin, saying,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I wash my hands in this thy dish,</p>
<p class="line">Oh man in the moon, do grant my wish,</p>
<p class="line">And come and take away this.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The moon too is invoked for the curing of corns.
&ldquo;Corns down here! No corns up there!&rdquo; is repeated nine
times. The fore-finger pointing first to the ground and then to the
sky.</p>
<p>When pricked by a thorn, use one of the following charms:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Christ was of a virgin born:</p>
<p class="line">And he was pricked by a thorn,</p>
<p class="line">And it did never &lsquo;bell&rsquo; (fester),</p>

<p>A knuckle-bone is often carried in the pocket as a cure and
preventive of cramp. I once saw an old woman turn out her pocket;
amongst its contents, as well as the knuckle-bone, was the tip of an
ox-tongue kept for good luck.</p>
<p>Slippers on going to bed are, when taken off, for the same complaint
often placed under the bed with the soles upwards, or on their heels
against the post of the bed with their toes up. The <span class=

cramp is keenless, Mary was sinless when she bore Jesus: let the cramp
go away in the name of Jesus.&rdquo; All the charms published by the
above-named author in his <i>History of Polperro</i> were taken from a
manuscript book, which belonged to a white witch.</p>
<p>When a foot has &ldquo;gone to sleep&rdquo; I have often seen people
wet their forefingers in their mouths, stoop and draw the form of a
cross on it. This is said to be an infallible remedy. Mr. Robert Hunt
has a rather similar cure for hiccough: &ldquo;Wet the forefinger of
the right hand with spittle, and cross the front of the left shoe (or
boot) three times, repeating the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer backwards.&rdquo;
The most popular cure with children is a heaping spoonful of moist
sugar. A sovereign remedy for hiccough and almost every complaint is a
small piece of a stale Good Friday bun grated into a glass of cold
water. This bun is hung up in the kitchen from one year to the other.

<p class="first">Mr. Robert Hunt gives in his book on <i>Old
Cornwall</i> a Latin charm for the staunching of blood. I find,
however, on making inquiries that it is not the one generally used,
which is as follows: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Christ was born in Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="line">Baptised in the river Jordan;</p>
<p class="line">There he digged a well,</p>
<p class="line">And turned the water against the hill,</p>
<p class="line">So shall thy blood stand still:</p>
<p class="line">In the name,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are other versions all much alike. A prose one
runs thus: &ldquo;Baptised in the river Jordan when the water was wild,
the water was good, the water stood, so shall thy blood. In the
name,&rdquo; etc.&mdash;T. Q. C.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle says a charmer once
told him the charm for staunching blood consisted in saying a verse
from the Psalms; but she could not read, and he was inclined to believe
the form was, &ldquo;Jesus came to the river Jordan, and said,
&lsquo;Stand,&rsquo; and it stood; and so I bid thee, blood, stand. In
the name,&rdquo; etc. For bleeding at the nose, a door-key is often
placed against the back. Cuts are plugged with cobwebs, flue from a
man&rsquo;s hat, tobacco leaves, and occasionally filled with salt.</p>
<p>Club-moss is considered good for eye diseases. On the third day of
the moon, when the thin crescent is seen for the first time, show it
the knife with which the moss for the charm is to be cut, and
repeat,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;As Christ healed the issue of blood,</p>
<p class="line">So I bid thee begone:</p>
<p class="line">In the name of,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Mr. Robert Hunt says,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Do thou cut what thou cuttest for
good!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;At sun-down, having carefully washed the hands,
the club-moss is to be cut kneeling. It is to be carefully wrapped in a
white cloth, and subsequently boiled in water taken from the spring
nearest its place of growth. This may be used as a fomentation. Or the
club-moss made into an ointment with butter made from the milk of a new
cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;stye&rdquo; on the eye is often stroked nine times with a
cat&rsquo;s tail; with a wedding ring taken from a dead woman&rsquo;s,
or a silver one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>from a drowned man&rsquo;s, hand. The
belief in the efficacy of a dead hand in curing diseases in Cornwall is
marvellous. I, in a short paper read at an Antiquarian meeting, gave
this instance, related to me by a medical man about ten years ago (now
dead). A day or two after, a number of other cases in proof of my
statement appeared, to my surprise, in our local papers, which, as well
as my own, I will transcribe. &ldquo;Once I attended a poor
woman&rsquo;s child for an obstinate case of sore eyes. One day when
leaving the house the mother said to me, &lsquo;Is there nothing more,
doctor, I can do for my little girl?&rsquo; I jokingly answered,
&lsquo;Nothing, unless you care to stroke them with a dead man&rsquo;s
hand.&rsquo; About a week after I met the woman in the streets, who
stopped me, and said, &lsquo;My child&rsquo;s eyes are getting better
at last, doctor.&rsquo; I expressed myself pleased that the ointment I
had given her was doing good. To my astonishment, she replied,
&lsquo;Oh, it is not that, we never used it; we took your advice about
the dead man&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; Until she recalled it to my memory, I
had quite forgotten my foolish speech.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am one of those
who can bear testimony to the fact of a cure having been effected by
the means above-named. I was born with a disfigurement on my upper lip.
My mother felt a great anxiety about this, so my nurse proposed that a
dead man&rsquo;s hand should be passed seven times over my lip. I was
taken to the house of one Robin Gendall, Causewayhead, Penzance, who at
that time was lying dead, and his hand was passed over my lip in the
manner named. By slow degrees my friends had the satisfaction of seeing
that the charm had taken effect.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Octogenarian.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;I may add my testimony to Miss Courtney&rsquo;s remarks as to
the belief in Cornwall in the virtue of the touch of a diseased part by
a dead man&rsquo;s hand. A case came under my knowledge at Penzance of
a child who had from birth a peculiar tuberous formation at the
junction of the nose with the forehead, which the medical men would not
cut for fear of severing veins. The child was taken by her mother to a
friend&rsquo;s house, in which were lying the remains of a young man
who had just died from consumption. The deceased&rsquo;s hand was
passed over the malformation seven times, and it soon began to grow
smaller and smaller.&rdquo; &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>have myself seen the
child since Miss Courtney read her paper (November, 1881), and, though
the mark is still apparent, I am assured it is surely, if slowly,
disappearing. A relation of mine also tells me that, like Miss
Courtney, she was taken to the Penzance witch for the purpose of having
a &lsquo;stye&rsquo; removed from one of her eyes by
charming.&rdquo;&mdash;Tramp.</p>
<p>I was told of many other cases&mdash;one by another surgeon; but it
would be useless to repeat them. I will end with one I have taken from
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, December, 1859:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady, who was staying lately at Penzance, attended a
funeral, and noticed that whilst the clergyman was reading the burial
service a woman forced her way through the pall-bearers to the edge of
the grave. When he came to the passage, &lsquo;Earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, dust to dust,&rsquo; she dropped a white cloth upon the coffin,
closed her eyes, and apparently said a prayer. On making inquiries as
to the cause of this proceeding, this lady found that a superstition
exists amongst the peasantry in that part, that if a person with a sore
be taken secretly to a corpse, the dead hand passed over the sore
place, and the bandage afterwards be dropped upon the coffin during the
reading of the burial service, a perfect cure will be the result. This
woman had a child with a bad leg, and she had followed this
superstition with a firm belief in its efficacy. The peasants, also, to
the present day wear charms, believing they will protect them from
sickness and other evils. The wife of the clergyman of the parish was
very charitable in attending the sick and dispensing medicines, and one
day a woman brought her a child having sore eyes to have them charmed,
having more faith in that remedy than in medicines. She was greatly
surprised to find that medicines only were given to
her.&rdquo;&mdash;E. R.</p>
<p>There is no virtue in the dead hand of a near relation. A curious
old troth plight was formerly practised in Cornwall: The couple broke a
wedding ring taken from the finger of a corpse, and each kept one half.
The editor of a local paper (<i>Cornishman</i>) once obtained a piece
of rope, with which a man was hanged, for a poor woman who had walked
fourteen miles to Bodmin in the hopes of getting it, that she might
effect the cure of her sore eyes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle writes that
&ldquo;a Cornish surgeon recommended a charmer as being more
efficacious than himself in curing shingles. According to the same
authority, a liquid composed of bramble and butter-dock leaves is
poured on the place, whilst a light stick is waved over the decoction
by the charmer, who repeats an incantation.&rdquo; It is popularly
supposed in Cornwall that should shingles meet around your waist, you
would die. The cures and charms against epilepsy are also very
numerous, and very generally used here. Thirty pence are collected at
the church door by the person afflicted, from one of the opposite sex,
changed for sacrament money (silver), and made into a ring to be worn
day and night. Very lately, at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Just-in-Penwith, a young woman begged from young men pennies to buy a
silver ring, a remedy which she believed would cure her fits. Another
charm, which it requires a person of strong nerves to perform, is to
walk thrice round a church at midnight, then enter and stand before the
altar. In connection with this rite the <abbr title=
"Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle relates the following:&mdash;&ldquo;At
Crowan (a village in West Cornwall), an epileptic subject entered the
church at midnight. As he was groping his way through the pitchy dark,
his heart suddenly leaped, and almost stood still. He uttered shriek
upon shriek, for his hand had grasped a man&rsquo;s head. He thought it
was the head of the famous Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Aubyn. He was removed in a fainting state, and it was then discovered
that he had seized the head of the sexton, who had come in to see that
nothing was done to frighten the man. The unfortunate fellow never
recovered from the shock, but died in a lunatic asylum.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
middle-aged Camborne man was subject to violent fits until two years
ago, when some one told him to kill a toad, put one of its legs in a
bag, and wear it suspended by a string around his neck. He did so, and
has never had a fit since.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Cornishman</i>, December,
1881.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Cornwall a black cock is buried on the spot where the
person is first attacked by epilepsy&rdquo; (to avert a similar
attack).&mdash;<i>Comparative Folk-Lore, Cornhill</i>, 1876.</p>
<p>For other charms see Addenda, <i>A Bundle of Charms</i>, by the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> A. H. Malan, <abbr title=
"Master of Arts">M.A.</abbr> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>Toads are also worn as charms for other diseases in this
county:&mdash;&ldquo;On the 27th July, 1875, I was lodging with a very
intelligent grazier and horse-dealer, at Tintagel, Cornwall, when he
was knocked down by a very serious attack of quinsey, to which he had
been subject for many years. He pulled through the crisis; and on being
sufficiently recovered he betook himself to a &lsquo;wise woman&rsquo;
at Camelford. She prescribed for him as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Get a
live toad, fasten a string around its throat, and hang it up till the
body drops from the head; then tie the string around your own neck, and
never take it off, night or day, till your fiftieth birthday.
You&rsquo;ll never have quinsey again.&rsquo; When I left Tintagel, I
understood that my landlord, greatly relieved in mind, had already
commenced the operation.&rdquo;&mdash;Augustus Jessop, D.D.</p>
<p>When a kettle won&rsquo;t boil, instead of the old adage, &ldquo;A
watched pot never boils,&rdquo; Cornish people say, &ldquo;There is a
toad or a frog in it.&rdquo; It is here considered lucky for a toad to
come into the house.</p>
<p>This charm for yellow jaundice I culled from the <i>Western
Antiquary</i>. &ldquo;I was walking in a village churchyard near the
town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell (I think in the autumn
of 1839), when I saw a woman approach an open grave. She stood by the
side of it and appeared to be muttering some words. She then drew out
from under her cloak a good-size baked meal-cake, threw it into the
grave and then left the place. Upon inquiry I found the cake was
composed of oatmeal mixed with dog&rsquo;s urine, baked, and thrown
into the grave as a charm for the yellow jaundice. This cure was at
that time commonly believed in by the peasantry of the
neighbourhood.&rdquo;&mdash;Joseph Cartwright, March, 1883.</p>
<p>Snakes avoid and dread ash-trees; a branch will keep them away. Our
peasantry believe however much you may try to kill quickly an adder or
snake, it will never die before sunset. Mr. Robert Hunt says,
&ldquo;When an adder is seen, a circle is to be rapidly drawn around it
and the sign of the cross made within it, whilst the first two verses
of the 68th Psalm are repeated.&rdquo; This is to destroy it; there are
also charms to be said for curing their bites, when they are
apostrophised &ldquo;under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>the ashen leaf.&rdquo; The
following old charm is to make them destroy themselves, by twisting
themselves up to nothing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Underneath this &lsquo;hazelen
mot&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4075src" href="#xd25e4075" name=

</div>
<p class="first">The words of charms must be muttered (they lose their
efficacy if recited aloud), and the charmer must never communicate them
to one of the same sex, for that transfers the power of charming to the
other person. Of superstitious rites practised for the cure of
whooping-cough, etc., I will speak a little further on. Cornishmen in
the last century from their cradles to their graves might have been
guided in their actions by old women&rsquo;s &ldquo;widdles&rdquo;
(superstitions), some as already shown are still foolishly followed;
but I hope that few people are silly enough at the present day to leave
their babies&rsquo; heads a twelvemonth unwashed, under the mistaken
notion that it would be unlucky to do it.</p>
<p>I have often and very recently seen the creases in the palms of
children&rsquo;s hands filled with dirt; to clean them before they were
a year old would take away riches&mdash;they would live and die poor.
Their nails, too, for the same period should be bitten, not cut, for
that would make them thieves. Hair at no age must be cut at the waning
of the moon, that would prevent its growing luxuriantly; locks shorn
off must be always burnt, it is unlucky to throw them away; then birds
might use them in their nests and weave them in so firmly that there
would be a difficulty in your rising at the last day. Children&rsquo;s
first teeth are burnt to prevent dog&rsquo;s or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>&ldquo;snaggles&rdquo; irregular teeth coming in
their stead. Coral necklaces are worn to ensure easy teething; the
beads are said to change their colour when the wearer is ill.
&ldquo;All locks are unlocked to favour easy birth (or
death).&rdquo;&mdash;A. H. Bickford, M.D., Camborne, 1883. Cornishmen
in the West are said to be born with tails; they drop off when the
Tamar is crossed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A popular notion amongst old folks is, that when a boy is
born on the waning moon the next birth will be a girl, and vice
vers&acirc;. They also say that when a birth takes place on the growing
of the moon, the next child will be of the same sex.&rdquo; A child
born in the interval between the old and new moons is fated to die
young, and babies with blue veins across their noses do not live to see
twenty-one. A cake called a groaning cake is made in some houses in
Cornwall after the birth of a child, of which every caller is expected
to partake. The mother often carries &ldquo;a groaning cake&rdquo; when
she is going to be &ldquo;upraised&rdquo; (churched); this she gives to
the first person she meets on her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kimbly&rdquo; is the name of an offering, generally a piece
of bread or cake, still given in some rural districts of this county to
the first person met when going to a wedding or a christening. It is
sometimes presented to anyone who brings the news of a a birth to an
interested party. Two young men, I knew about thirty years ago, were
taking a walk in West Cornwall; crossing over a bridge they met a
procession carrying a baby to the parish church, where the child was to
be baptised. Unaware of this curious custom, they were very much
surprised at having a piece of cake put into their hands. A magistrate
wrote to the <i>Western Morning News</i>, in January, 1884, saying,
that on his way to his petty sessions he had had one of these
christening cakes thrust into his hand, but unluckily he did not state
in what parish this happened. This called forth several letters on the
subject, parts of which I will quote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About thirty years ago at the christening of a brother (in
the Meneage district, Helston), and when the family party were ready
for the walk to the afternoon service in Cury church, I well recollect
seeing the old nurse wrap in a pure white sheet of paper what she
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>called the &lsquo;cheeld&rsquo;s
fuggan.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4124src" href="#xd25e4124"
name="xd25e4124src">4</a> This was a cake with plenty of currants and
saffron, about the size of a modern tea-plate. It was to be given to
the first person met on returning, after the child was christened. It
happened that, as most of the parishioners were at the service, no one
was met until near home, almost a mile from the church, when a tipsy
village carpenter rambled around a corner, right against our party, and
received the cake. Regrets were expressed that the
&lsquo;cheeld&rsquo;s fuggan&rsquo; should have fallen to the lot of
this notoriously evil liver, and my idea was that it was a bad omen.
However as my brother has always been a veritable Rechabite, enjoys
good health, a contented mind, and enough of this world&rsquo;s goods
to satisfy every moderate want, no evil can thus far be traced to the
mischance.&rdquo;&mdash;J. C., <i>Western Morning News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Kimbly&rsquo; in East Cornwall is the name of a
thing, commonly a piece of bread, which is given under peculiar
circumstances at weddings and christenings. When the parties set out
from the house to go to church, or on their business, one person is
sent before them with this selected piece of bread in his or her hand
(a woman is commonly preferred for this office), and the piece is given
to the first individual that is met. I interpret it to have some
reference to the idea of the evil eye and its influence, which might
fall on the married persons or on the child, which is sought to be
averted by this unexpected gift. It is also observed in births, in
order that by this gift envy may be turned away from the infant or
happy parents. This &lsquo;kimbly&rsquo; is commonly given to the
person bringing the first news to those interested in the
birth.&rdquo;&mdash;T. Q. Couch, <i>Western Morning News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I witnessed this custom very frequently at Looe, in
South-east Cornwall, from fifty to sixty-five years ago. I believe it
is correct to say that this gift was there a small cake, made for the
occasion, and termed the &lsquo;christening-crib,&rsquo; a crib of
bread or cake being a provincialism for a bit of bread,&rdquo;
etc.&mdash;William Pengelly, <i>Western Morning News</i>.</p>
<p>Children, when they leave small bits of meat, etc., on their plates,
are in Cornwall often told &ldquo;to eat up their cribs.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=

<p>&ldquo;On the afternoons of Good Friday, little girls of Carharrack,
in the parish of Gwennap (West Cornwall), take their dolls to a stream
at the foot of Carnmarth, and there christen them. Occasionally a young
man will take upon himself the office of minister, and will sprinkle
and name the dolls.&rdquo;&mdash;Charles James, Gwennap.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle, Vicar of
Godolphin, says, &ldquo;That once he was sent for to baptise a child,
around whose neck hung a little bag, which the mother said contained a
bit of a donkey&rsquo;s ear, and that this charm had cured the child of
a most distressing cough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some parts of Cornwall it is considered a sure sign of

&ldquo;First at the font, never at the altar.&rdquo; When I was young,

congregation for you, and are sure not to catch cold. A friend lately
sent me the following charm of one year&rsquo;s duration which prevents
your feeling or taking a cold. &ldquo;Eat a large apple at Hallow-een

<p>Children with rickets were taken by their parents on the three first
Sundays in May to be dipped at sunrise in one of the numerous Cornish
holy wells, and then put to sleep in the sun, with sixpence under their
heads. Small pieces torn from their clothes were left on the bushes to
propitiate the pixies. For the same disease they were passed nine times
through a M&ecirc;n-an-tol (holed stone). A man stood on one side, and
a woman on the other, of the stone. The child was passed with the sun
from east to west, and from right to left; a boy from the woman to the
man, a girl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>from the man to the woman. This order is always,
in these charms, strictly observed. As lately as 1883, in the village
of Sancred, West Cornwall, a little girl, suffering from
whooping-cough, was passed from a man to a woman nine times under a
donkey&rsquo;s belly; a little boy standing the while at the
donkey&rsquo;s head feeding it with &ldquo;cribs&rdquo; of wheaten
bread. My informant did not know if on this occasion any incantation
was repeated. Another family, he tells me, some years back were in the
same neighbourhood cured of the whooping-cough by donkey&rsquo;s hair,
which was dried on the baking iron of the open hearth, reduced to
powder, and administered to them. There are very various ways of doing
this, one is between thin slices of bread and butter. Some authorities
say the latter ingredients must belong to a couple called John and
Joan. Mr. Robert Hunt gives a charm which in a measure combines the two
above-mentioned. &ldquo;The child must be passed naked nine times over
the back and under the belly of a female donkey. Three spoonfuls of
milk drawn from the teats of the animal, three hairs cut from its back,
and three from its belly, are to stand in the milk three hours, and to
be given in three doses repeated on three mornings.&rdquo; Mr. Hunt
also says, &ldquo;There were some doggerel lines connected with the
ceremony which have escaped my memory, and I have endeavoured in vain
to find anyone remembering them. They were to the effect that as Christ
placed the cross on the ass&rsquo;s back when he rode into Jerusalem
and so rendered the animal holy, if the child touched where Jesus sat
it should cough no more.&rdquo; I will quote another of Mr.
Hunt&rsquo;s charms. &ldquo;Gather nine spar-stones (quartz) from a
running stream, taking care not to interrupt the free passage of the
water in doing so. Then dip a quart of water from the stream, which
must be taken in the direction in which the stream runs&mdash;by no
means must the vessel be dipped against the stream. Then make the nine
stones red-hot, and throw them into the quart of water. Bottle the
prepared water, and give the afflicted child a wine-glass of this water
for nine mornings.&rdquo; Other remedies are to cross the child over
running water nine times, or under a bramble bough bent into the ground
(this latter and through a cleft ash are also tried for hernia). Some
nurses take children, with whooping-cough, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>out
for a walk, in hopes of meeting a man on a white or piebald horse.
Should they be fortunate enough to do so, they ask the rider how they
can cure the patient: his advice is always implicitly followed.</p>
<p>Children with dirty habits are often told that a &ldquo;mousey
pasty&rdquo; shall be cooked for their dinners.</p>
<p>Cornish children are warned by their nurses not to grimace, lest,
whilst so doing, the wind should change and their faces always remain
contorted. There is another form in which this warning is often given:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make mock of a &lsquo;magum&rsquo; (May-game), for
you may be struck comical yourself one day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Magum&rdquo;
in most cases means a facetious person, one who is full of merry
pranks; and the expressions, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar
magum,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He&rsquo;s full of his magums,&rdquo; are often
heard. But the idea intended to be conveyed in the first saying is that
it is wrong to make fun of a person suffering from an infirmity, which
may at any time afflict the jeerer. The puritanical notion of Sunday
lingers in the belief in Cornwall that it is unlucky to use a scissors
on that day, even to cut your nails; you must</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cut them on Monday, before your fast you

(white spots) on their thumb-nails, as</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;Gifts on the thumb are sure to come,</p>

<p class="first">Occasionally white spots on the five fingers are named
as follows: &ldquo;A gift, a friend, a foe, a true lover, a journey to
go.&rdquo; Should the little ones, when picking flowers, sting
themselves with nettles, they are of course in this locality, as
elsewhere in England, taught to rub the spot with dock-leaves,
repeating the words, &ldquo;In dock, out nettle;&rdquo; but they are
often told in addition to wet the place affected with their spittle,
and make a cross over it with their thumb-nails, pressed down as
heavily as possible. School-boys and school-girls often years ago
practised a cruel jest on their more innocent companions. They induced
them to pick a nettle by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>saying &ldquo;Nettles won&rsquo;t
sting this month.&rdquo; When the children were stung and complained,
the retort was, &ldquo;I never said they would not sting you.&rdquo;
The blue scabious in Cornwall is never plucked. It is called the
devil&rsquo;s bit, and the superstition is handed down from one
generation of children to another that, should they transgress and do
so, the devil will appear to them in their dreams at night. But anyone
who wishes to dream of the devil should pin four ivy-leaves to the
corners of his pillow. Flowers plucked from churchyards bring ill-luck,
and even visitations from spirits on the plucker. Wrens and robins are
sacred in the eyes of Cornish boys, for</p>

<p class="first">Earwigs they hold in detestation, as they believe
that, should they get into their ears, they will cause madness. There
is a legend popular amongst them which relates that a poor man was once
driven frantic by a very queer sensation in his head. At last, not
being able to bear it any longer, he went into a meat-market, laid it
down upon a block, and asked a butcher to chop it off. Whilst in this
recumbent position an earwig crept out of his ear, and the pain
instantly ceased. Our school-boys have other fallacies, such as, the
pain caused by a &ldquo;custice,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a stroke across the
palm of the hand with a cane, may be neutralised by placing two hairs
on it crossways. Also that the wound made by a nail can be kept from
festering by wrapping the nail in a piece of fat bacon to prevent its
rusting.</p>
<p>School-girls&rsquo; superstitions are more sentimental, and often
connected with wishing. If, when talking together, one accidentally
makes a rhyme, she wishes; and, should she be asked a question before
she speaks again, to which she can answer Yes, she thinks that she is
sure to get it. When an eyelash falls out its owner puts it on the tip
of her nose, wishes and blows at it; should she blow it off, she will
have her wish. Should she by chance hear a dog dreaming, she stands up,
puts a foot on each side of it, and then wishes. Years ago one gravely
told me that if I wanted to know a dog&rsquo;s dreams I must throw a
pocket-handkerchief over it when sleeping and keep it there until it
awoke; then, before getting into bed, put it under my pillow, and I
should have the same dream. Dreams in Cornwall are always said to go by
contraries. &ldquo;If you dream of the dead you will hear tell of the
living,&rdquo; etc. To dream anyone is kissing you is a sign of deceit.
&ldquo;Of fruit out of season, trouble without reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">To see if a friend loves her, a Cornish girl pulls out

the root from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165"
name="pb165">165</a>]</span>palm of her own hand. If this can be done
the test is successful. When a little older there are many ways in
which our maidens &ldquo;try for their sweethearts.&rdquo; A few of the
rules prescribed for these rites, which have been handed down from
generation to generation, may be worth transcribing. &ldquo;Draw a
bracken fern, cut it at the bottom of the stalk; there you will find
your lover&rsquo;s initials.&rdquo; Take an apple-pip between the
forefinger and the thumb, flip it into the air, saying, &ldquo;North,
south, east, west, tell me where my love doth rest,&rdquo; and watch
the direction in which it falls. Go into the fields at the time of the
new moon and pluck a piece of herb yarrow; put it when going to bed
under your pillow, saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Good night, fair yarrow,</p>
<p class="line">Thrice good night to thee;</p>
<p class="line">I hope before to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out of your bed-room window on <abbr title=

and you will marry the same, or one of the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To lose your apron or your garter shows that your lover is thinking
of you. Three candles burning at the same time is the sign of a
wedding; and the girl who is nearest to the door, the cupboard, and the
shortest candle, will be married first. When two people accidentally
say the same thing at the same time the one who finishes first will be
married first. There are a great number of omens similar to these last,
equally stupid, and not worthy of notice.</p>

down until they are tired, when they upset him on the nearest pile or
in a pond. This is called riding in the &lsquo;one-wheel coach;&rsquo;

<p>When a younger sister marries first the elder is said to dance in
the &ldquo;bruss&rdquo; (short twigs of heath or furze), from an old
custom of dancing without shoes on the furze prickles which get
detached from the stalk. Only old maids can rear a myrtle, and they
will not blossom when trained against houses where there are none. It
is considered extremely unlucky here to break or lose your
wedding-ring, also for a wedding-cake to crack after baking. A lady
told me of one made for a couple she knew, which fell to pieces when
taken out of the oven. Before the wedding-day came the bride had
sickened of some disorder, was dead, and buried. A hole in a loaf, too,
foretells a separation in a family; and to turn one upside down on a
table wrecks a vessel. &ldquo;If a hare cross the path of a wedding
party, the bride or bridegroom will die within seven
years.&rdquo;&mdash;<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle,
<i>Cornubiana</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young woman who has been three times a bridesmaid will
never be a bride.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was an old custom, religiously
observed until lately in Zennor and adjacent parishes on the north
coast of Cornwall, to waylay a married couple on their wedding night
and flog them to bed with cords, sheep-spans, or anything handy for the
purpose, believing that this rough treatment would ensure them
happiness and the &lsquo;heritage and gift that cometh of the
Lord,&rsquo; of a numerous family. At more modish weddings the guests
merely entered the bridal chamber, and threw stockings in which stones
or something to make weight were placed, at the bride and bridegroom in
bed. The first one hit of the happy pair betokened the sex of their
first-born.&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
<p>Should there be a great discrepancy between the ages of the bride
and bridegroom, or the marriage of a couple in any way be a matter of
notoriety, they are in West Cornwall on their wedding night often
treated to a &ldquo;shallal,&rdquo; a serenade on tin-kettles, pans,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>marrow-bones, &amp;c. Any great noise in this
part of the county is described as being &ldquo;a reg&rsquo;lar
shallal.&rdquo; In olden times (in fact the custom is not quite
discontinued at the present day, for I heard a whisper of one having
taken place in a small fishing-village two years ago) married people
accused of immorality were in Cornwall punished by a
&ldquo;riding.&rdquo; I will give the description of one by Mr. T. Q.
Couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cart was got, donkeys were harnessed in, and a pair
personating the guilty or suspected were driven through the streets,
attended by a train of men and boys. At Polperro (East Cornwall) the
attendants acted as trumpeters; the bullocks&rsquo; horns used by the
fishermen at sea for fog or night signals were always available for the
purpose. The mummers were very cautious, by careful disguise in dress
or voice, and avoiding of anything directly libellous in their rather
ribald dialogue, to keep themselves out of the clutches of the law. I
remember one <i>riding</i> when an old rusty cannon of the smuggling
period was waked up from its long quiet for service for the occasion,
and bursting, led to the mutilation of several and the death of
one.&rdquo; On the borders of Devon and in that county this ceremony
was known as a &ldquo;mock-hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lock of hair hanging down over the forehead is in Cornwall called
&ldquo;a widow&rsquo;s lock;&rdquo; (and children are still here told
when it falls down &ldquo;to shed their hair back out of their
eyes.&rdquo;) A foolish warning says,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Go thro&rsquo; a gate when there&rsquo;s a stile
hard by,</p>
<p class="line">You&rsquo;ll be a widow before you die.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The sudden appearance of rats or mice in Cornish
houses is said to be a certain forerunner of sickness and death. Many
curious tales are told in confirmation of this superstition; one I
particularly remember was in connection with a young man who was killed
on the West Cornwall Railway. After the accident, they vanished as
quickly as they came. It is also considered to be very unlucky for a
bird to perch on the window-sill of a sick person&rsquo;s room,
farewell then to all chances of recovery; and strange birds coming into
a house (especially a robin through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>back door) foretell
the death of some one in it, or connected with the family. I was once
where a little child lay dying, a small brown bird sang on the
window-sill, the nurse told me that it was waiting to carry away the
child&rsquo;s soul. &ldquo;But when a flea bites a sick person he is
sure not to be dangerously ill, as it is well known that they never
bite those who have had their death-stroke.&rdquo; The superstitions
that you cannot die easily on pillows stuffed with wild birds&rsquo;
feathers, and that life goes out with the tide, are as current here as
in other places. Death in Cornwall is often spoken of as &ldquo;going
round land,&rdquo; and &ldquo;gone dead&rdquo; is a common idiom. A
threat to kill is occasionally conveyed in the words &ldquo;I will give
you your quietus.&rdquo; In some cases it is supposed that life may be
restored after death if when the breath stops the body be violently
shaken. When a member of a family dies, his death it is said will bring
two others with it,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4393src" href=
"#xd25e4393" name="xd25e4393src">7</a> from the idea that one
misfortune never comes alone. A Cornish country vicarage was lately
startled by the tolling at an unwonted hour of the church bell. On
sending to ascertain the cause of the disturbance an &ldquo;old
inhabitant was found in the belfry, who had been engaged in the absence
or illness of the usual sexton to dig the grave. He said in explanation
that in his time it was always usual for the gravedigger to toll the
bell three times before breaking the consecrated
ground.&rdquo;&mdash;<abbr>J. H. C.</abbr>, <i>Notes and Queries</i>,
5th series, vol. ii., August, 1874.</p>
<p>A corpse should never be carried to church by a new road, and should
a hearse stop on its way to the churchyard there will soon be another
death in the house. Singing funerals, or as they are called in Cornwall
buryings (pronounced &ldquo;berrins&rdquo;), were once almost universal
(and one may still occasionally be met). The mourners and friends
following the coffin sang as they walked through the streets or lanes
their favourite hymns, often to most elaborate tunes.</p>

<p>Few people in old days were buried on the north side of a church.
Flowers and shrubs planted in Cornish churchyards are never plucked,
from the fear that the spirits of the departed will at night visit the
desecrator. Should an urn found in a &ldquo;barrow&rdquo; be taken into
a house, the person whose ashes it contained will haunt it; it must be
broken up and the pieces hidden. Cross-roads, the former burying-place
of suicides, are after nightfall avoided, such spots being haunted; but
if you have courage to go there at midnight and wish, you will get your
wish.</p>
<p>With a few general superstitions I shall bring this part to an end.
It is unlucky in Cornwall to see the new moon first over the left
shoulder, or through a window, especially if the day should happen to
be a Friday. To ensure good luck on your first sight of her, you should
curtsey, spit on your money and turn it in your pocket. (A man well
paid for any chance job early in the day calls it here &ldquo;a
hansel,&rdquo; and spits on the money for good luck.) If you
particularly desire anything, look at the new moon and wish before you
speak. You may also wish when you see a falling star, and if you can
succeed in framing it before it disappears your wish will be granted.
Seeing the new moon in the old moon&rsquo;s arms is a sign of a change
in the weather, so is a star passing over it. The change will be for
the worse if the moon goes over the star. &ldquo;Herbs for drying must
be gathered at full moon; winter fruit picked and stored at full moon,
not to lose its plumpness. Timber should be felled on the bating of the
moon, because the sap is then down, and the wood will be more
durable.&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
<p>Card-table Superstitions:&mdash;&ldquo;Good luck in cards, bad luck
in a husband (or wife).&rdquo; &ldquo;A shuffling cut is good for the
dealer.&rdquo; &ldquo;1 2 3 4 played in succession kiss the
dealer.&rdquo; To cut an honour for the trump card is unlucky, for
&ldquo;When quality opens the door there is poverty behind;&rdquo; but
&ldquo;Good luck lurks under a black deuce&rdquo; (it should be touched
by the cutter).</p>
<p>Superstitions connected with the body:&mdash;A twitching in the
eyelid is lucky; but you must not say when it comes nor when it
goes.</p>
<p>Right eye itching, a sign of laughter; but left over right,
you&rsquo;ll cry before night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"

<p>Fire Superstitions:&mdash;A difficulty in kindling the fire in the
mornings is a sign of anger; burning only on one side, of a separation
in the family (some say of a wedding). A flake of smut on the bar of
the grate shows that a stranger is coming to the house. Should the fire
be burning brightly, he will bring good news; but if the contrary, bad.
If after you poke the fire it burns up brightly, your sweetheart is in
a good temper; but should it not improve he is in a bad one. A coal
popping out of the fire is either a cradle or coffin, or a purse. It is
allowed to cool and then examined to find out the shape; if pronounced
to be a purse, it is shaken close to the ear, when should it jingle it
is said to contain money. I once saw this done in a school by its
mistress. It is unlucky to put a bellows on a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; trees,&rdquo; small branches of dried seaweed,
are sometimes hung up in chimneys to protect houses from fire; or a
Passover biscuit suspended by a string from a nail in the wall.

<p>There are so many unlucky omens in Cornwall that to believe in them
all would make life miserable, and to enumerate them would fill a

amply suffice. &ldquo;A work begun on Friday is never ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="xd25e3675"><span class="xd25e3675init">M</span>any old games
worth recording are still played by Cornish children, out of doors in
summer, indoors in winter, and at their numerous school-treats. To
those common elsewhere, other names in Cornwall are often given, and
different words sung. Some well known thirty-five years ago, now (1890)
live only in the memory of those who were children then, or linger in a
very fragmentary state in some remote country districts. Such as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here come three dukes a-riding.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To play this the children were divided into two
parties. In the first were only the three dukes; in the second the
other players, who stood in a long line, linked hand in hand, facing
them,&mdash;the mother in the middle, with her daughters ranged
according to size on each side of her. One duke was chosen as
spokesman, and he began the following dialogue, which was sung; the
party singing advanced and retreated, whilst the others stood
still:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">

<p class="first">The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> S. Rundle,
vicar of Godolphin, near Helston, saw some children lately in his
neighbourhood playing a portion of this game, when to &ldquo;Here comes
three dukes a-riding&rdquo; they added&mdash;&ldquo;My rancy, dancy
dukes.&rdquo; Mr. Halliwell Phillips, in his <i>Nursery Rhymes and
Tales of England</i>, has published three versions of it, but the game
as played in Cornwall has some additional couplets. <span class=

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Pray, pretty Miss.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For this&mdash;quite, I think, a thing of the
past&mdash;the children (a boy and girl alternately) formed a ring. One
stood in the middle holding a white handkerchief by two of its corners:
if a boy he would single out one of the girls, dance backwards and
forwards opposite to her, and sing&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Pray, pretty Miss, will you come out?</p>
<p class="line">Will you come out? will you come out?</p>
<p class="line">Pray, pretty Miss, will you come out,</p>
<p class="line">To help me in my dancing?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">If the answer were &ldquo;No!&rdquo; spoken with
averted head over the left shoulder, the rhyme ran&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Then you are a naughty Miss!</p>
<p class="line">Then you are a naughty Miss!</p>
<p class="line">Then you are a naughty Miss!</p>
<p class="line">Won&rsquo;t help me in my dancing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Occasionally three or four in turn refused. When the
request was granted the words were changed to&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Now you are a good Miss!</p>
<p class="line">Now you are a good Miss!</p>
<p class="line">Now you are a good Miss!</p>
<p class="line">To help me in my dancing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The handkerchief was then carefully spread on the
floor; the couple knelt on it and kissed: the child formerly in the
middle joined the ring, and the other took his place, or if he
preferred it, remained in the centre; in that case the children clasped
hands and sang together&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Pray, pretty Miss (or Sir),&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The last to enter the ring had always the privilege of
selecting the next partner.</p>
<p>In all these childish games, to prevent disputes, and decide who
shall be middleman, hide first, etc., one or other of the following
formul&aelig; is always recited by the eldest of the party,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>who as he repeats the words points with his
forefinger at each player in succession until he comes to the end of
the rhyme. The person then indicated goes out:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">To this latter there are several nonsensical modern
editions.</p>
<p>A game with a jingle somewhat like the first is played by children
at Newlyn West, near Penzance, called&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Vesey, vasey, vum.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="line">Find if you can and take it home,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">A search is then made for the hidden object: when
found the finder in his turn is blindfolded.</p>
<p>After this digression I will give all the other forgotten games
before describing those still played.</p>

(all were extended towards the centre of the circle); &ldquo;Right arms
out!&rdquo; (all wheeled round with arms outstretched in the contrary
direction); &ldquo;Shake yourselves a little and little and turn
yourselves about.&rdquo; The circle was reformed,
&ldquo;Friskee,&rdquo; etc., was repeated, and the game went on until
all the different parts of the body had been named.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All the children in this game, except one who left the
room, called themselves by the name of some bird, beast or fish. The

said&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">And find me out the &mdash;&mdash;:&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">giving the assumed name of one of the players. If the
fool fixed on the right person, he stayed in and the other went out,
which of course involved re-naming; but if he made a mistake they all
cried out&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fool! fool! go back to school,</p>
<p class="line">And learn your letters better.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He retired, pretended to knock his head against the
door, and returned, when he was again asked in the same words to name
some other player.</p>
<p>Some of the games were much rougher, such as &ldquo;Pig in the
middle and can&rsquo;t get out,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solomon had a great
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first, one of the children stood in the centre, whilst the
others danced around him in a circle, saying, &ldquo;Pig in the middle
and can&rsquo;t get out.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my
key but I will get out,&rdquo; and threw the whole weight of his body
suddenly on the clasped hands of a couple to try and unlock them. When
he had succeeded he changed the words to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve broken your
locks, and I have got out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the pair whose hands he had opened took his place, and he
joined the ring. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the second, the players knelt in a line; the one at the head, in
a very solemn tone, chanted, &ldquo;Solomon had a great dog;&rdquo; the
others answered in the same way, &ldquo;Just so&rdquo; (this was always
the refrain). Then the first speaker made two or three more ridiculous
speeches, ending with, &ldquo;And at last this great dog died, and fell
down,&rdquo; giving at the same time a violent lurch against his next
neighbour, who, not expecting it, fell against his, and so on to the
end of the line.</p>

player on his open palm. Another took it up quickly, and tried to
&ldquo;scat&rdquo; his opponent&rsquo;s hand before he could draw it
away. Sometimes a feint of taking the paper-knife was made three or
four times before it was really done. When the &ldquo;scat&rdquo; was

that side, saying, &ldquo;Malaga, Malaga raisins, very good raisins I
vow,&rdquo; and told him to do the same. Should he fail to pass it from
right to left, when he in his turn gave it to his neighbour, without
being told where the mistake lay he was made to pay a forfeit.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Old Witch.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The children chose from their party an old witch (who
is supposed to hide herself) and a mother. The other players are the
daughters, and are called by the names of the week. The mother says
that she is going to market, and will bring home for each the thing
that she most wishes for. Upon this they all name something. Then,
after telling them upon no account to allow anyone to come into the
house, she gives her children in charge of her eldest daughter Sunday,
and goes away. In a moment, the witch makes her appearance, and asks to
borrow some trifle.</p>
<p>Sunday at first refuses, but, after a short parley, goes into the
next room to fetch the required article. In her absence the witch
steals the youngest of the children (Saturday), and runs off with her.
Sunday, on her return, seeing that the witch has left, thinks there
must be something wrong, and counts the children, saying,
&ldquo;Monday, Tuesday,&rdquo; etc., until she comes to Saturday, who
is missing. She then pretends to cry, wrings her hands, and sobs
out&mdash;&ldquo;Mother will beat me when she comes home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the mother&rsquo;s return, she, too, counts the children, and,
finding Saturday gone, asks Sunday where she is. Sunday answers,
&ldquo;Oh, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>mother! an old witch called, and asked to borrow
&mdash;&mdash;, and, whilst I was fetching it, she ran off with
Saturday.&rdquo; The mother scolds and beats her, tells her to be more
careful in the future, and again sets off for the market. This is
repeated until all the children but Sunday have been stolen. Then the
mother and Sunday, hand in hand, go off to search for them. They meet
the old witch, who has them all crouching down in a line behind
her.</p>
<p><i>Mother.</i> Have you seen my children?</p>
<p><i>O. W.</i> Yes! I think, by Eastgate.</p>
<p>The mother and Sunday retire, as if to go there, but, not finding
them, again return to the witch, who this time sends them to Westgate,
then to Southgate and Northgate. At last one of the children pops her
head up over the witch&rsquo;s shoulder, and cries out, &ldquo;Here we
are, mother.&rdquo; Then follows this dialogue:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>M.</i> I see my children, may I go in?</p>
<p><i>O. W.</i> No! your boots are too dirty.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> I will take them off.</p>
<p><i>O. W.</i> Your stockings are too dirty.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> I will take them off.</p>
<p><i>O.</i> W. Your feet are too dirty.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> I will cut them off.</p>
<p><i>O. W.</i> Then the blood will stream over the floor.</p>
<p>The mother at this loses patience, and pushes her way in, the witch
trying in vain to keep her out. She, with all her children, then chase
the witch until they catch her; when they pretend to bind her hand and
foot, put her on a pile, and burn her, the children fanning the
imaginary flames with their pinafores. Sometimes the dialogue after
&ldquo;Here we are, mother,&rdquo; is omitted, and the witch is at once
chased.</p>
<p>Mr. Halliwell Phillips calls this the &ldquo;Game of the
Gipsy,&rdquo; and gives some rhymes to which it is played, but I have
never heard them in this county.</p>
<p>The next, a game quite unknown to me, I took down from the lips of a
little girl in West Cornwall, in 1882, who told me it was a great
favourite with her and her playmates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the party is chosen for ghost (if dressed in
white so much the better); she hides in a corner; the other children
are a mother and daughters. The eldest daughter says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother, please give me a piece of bread and
butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Let me (or &ldquo;leave me&rdquo;) look at your hands,
child. Why, they are very dirty.</p>
<p><i>E. D.</i> I will go to the well and wash them.</p>
<p>She goes to the corner, the ghost peeps up, and she rushes back,
crying out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! mother! I have seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Nonsense, child! it was only your father&rsquo;s
nightshirt I have washed and hung out to dry. Go again.</p>
<p>The child goes, and the same thing happens. She returns,
saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother! I have seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Nonsense, child! we will take a candle, and all go
together to search for it. The mother picks up a twig for a candle, and
they set off. When they come near to the ghost, she appears from her
hiding-place, mother and children rush away in different directions;
the ghost chases them until she has caught one, who in her turn becomes
ghost.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">Mother, Mother, may I go out to
Play?</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I thought this game was a thing of the past, but I
came on some children playing it in the streets of Penzance, in 1883.
It may be played by any number, and, as in the two former games, one is
chosen for mother. This is the dialogue:</p>
<p><i>C.</i> Mother, mother, may I (or we) go out to play?</p>
<p><i>M.</i> No, child! no, child! not for the day.</p>
<p><i>C.</i> Why, mother? why, mother? I won&rsquo;t stay long.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Make three pretty courtesies, and away! begone!</p>
<p><i>C.</i> One for mammy, one for daddy, one for Uncle John.</p>
<p>The child, as she mentions the names, spreads out the skirts of her
dress and courtesies, after which she retires to a little distance, and
then returns. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>M.</i> Where, child! where, child! have you been all the day?</p>
<p><i>C.</i> Up to granny&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> What have you been doing there?</p>
<p>The answer to this is often &ldquo;Washing dolls&rsquo;
clothes,&rdquo; but anything may be mentioned.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> What did she give you?</p>
<p>The reply is again left to the child&rsquo;s fancy.</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Where&rsquo;s my share?</p>
<p><i>C.</i> The cat ate it. What&rsquo;s in that box, mother?</p>
<p><i>M.</i> Twopence, my child.</p>
<p><i>C.</i> What for, mother?</p>
<p><i>M.</i> To buy a stick to beat you, and a rope to hang you, my
child.</p>
<p>The child at this tries to snatch at the box, the mother chases her
until she has caught her (when there are several children, until she
has caught one), she then pretends to beat her, and puts her hands
around her neck as if she were going to hang her.</p>

vinegar, sour?&rdquo; Her answer is always taken in a contrary sense,

advances and kisses her, they change places, and the game begins
again.</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Of a stout cripple that kept the high-way,</p>

<p class="line">A story I&rsquo;ll tell you that pleasant shall be,</p>
<p class="line">The Cripple of Cornwall surnamed was he.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">He crept on his hands and his knees up and down,</p>
<p class="line">In a torn jacket and a ragged torn gown,</p>
<p class="line">For he had never a leg to the knee;</p>
<p class="line">The Cripple of Cornwall surnamed was he.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">He was of a stomach courageous and stout,</p>
<p class="line">For he had no cause to complain of the gout;</p>
<p class="line">To go upon stilts most cunning was he,</p>
<p class="line">With a staff on his neck most gallant to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Yea, no good fellowship would he forsake,</p>
<p class="line">Were it in secret a horse for to take;</p>
<p class="line">His stool he kept close in a hollow tree,</p>
<p class="line">That stood from the city a mile, two, or three.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Thus all the day long he begg&rsquo;d for relief,</p>
<p class="line">And all the night long he played the false thief;</p>
<p class="line">For seven years together this custom kept he,</p>
<p class="line">And no man knew him such a person to be.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">There were few graziers went on the way,</p>
<p class="line">But unto the Cripple for passage did pay,</p>
<p class="line">And every brave merchant that he did descry,</p>
<p class="line">He emptied their purses ere they did pass by.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The noble Lord Courtney, both gallant and bold,</p>
<p class="line">Rode forth with great plenty of silver and gold,</p>
<p class="line">At Exeter there a purchase to pay,</p>
<p class="line">But that the false Cripple the journey did stay.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">For why, the false Cripple heard tidings of late,</p>
<p class="line">As he sat for alms at the nobleman&rsquo;s gate;</p>
<p class="line">This is, quoth the Cripple, a booty for me,</p>
<p class="line">And I&rsquo;ll follow it closely as closely may be.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Then to his companions the matter he mov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p class="line">Which their false actions before had prov&rsquo;d;</p>
<p class="line">They make themselves ready, and deeply they swear</p>
<p class="line">The money&rsquo;s their own before they come there.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Upon his two stilts the Cripple did mount,</p>
<p class="line">To have the best share it was his full account,</p>
<p class="line">All clothed in canvass down to the ground,</p>
<p class="line">He took up his place his mates with him round.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Then came the Lord Courtney with half-a-score men,</p>
<p class="line">Yet little suspecting these thieves in their den,</p>
<p class="line">And they perceiving them come to their hand,</p>
<p class="line">In a dark evening bid them to stand.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Deliver thy purse, quoth the Cripple, with speed,</p>
<p class="line">We be good fellows and therefore have need,</p>
<p class="line">Not so, quoth Lord Courtney, but this I&rsquo;ll tell
ye,</p>
<p class="line">Win it and wear it, else get none of me.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With that the Lord Courtney stood in his defence,</p>
<p class="line">And so did his servants, but, ere they went hence,</p>
<p class="line">Two of the true men were slain in this fight,</p>
<p class="line">And four of the thieves were put to the flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">And while for their safeguard they run thus away,</p>
<p class="line">The jolly bold Cripple did hold them in play,</p>
<p class="line">And with his pike-staff he wounded them so,</p>
<p class="line">As they were unable to run or to go.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With fighting the Lord Courtney was out of breath,</p>
<p class="line">And most of his servants were wounded to death,</p>
<p class="line">Then came other horsemen riding so fast,</p>
<p class="line">The Cripple was forced to fly at the last.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">And over a river that run there beside,</p>
<p class="line">Which was very deep, and eighteen foot wide,</p>
<p class="line">With his long staff and his stilts leaped he,</p>
<p class="line">And shifted himself in an old hollow tree;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Then throughout the city was hue and cry made,</p>
<p class="line">To have these thieves apprehended and staid;</p>
<p class="line">The Cripple he creeps on his hands and his knees,</p>
<p class="line">And in the high-way great passing he sees.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">And as they came riding he begging doth say,</p>
<p class="line">O give me one penny, good masters, I pray,</p>
<p class="line">And thus unto Exeter creeps he along,</p>
<p class="line">No man suspecting that he had done wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Anon the Lord Courtney he spies in the street,</p>
<p class="line">He comes unto him and kisses his feet,</p>
<p class="line">God save your honor and keep you from ill,</p>
<p class="line">And from the hands of your enemies still.</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Amen, quoth Lord Courtney, and therewith threw down</p>
<p class="line">Unto the poor Cripple an English crown,</p>
<p class="line">Away went the Cripple, and thus he did think,</p>
<p class="line">Five hundred pounds more will make me to drink.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">In vain that hue and cry it was made,</p>
<p class="line">They found none of them though the country was
laid,</p>
<p class="line">But this grieved the Cripple night and day,</p>
<p class="line">That he so unluckily missed of his play.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Nine hundred pounds this Cripple had got</p>
<p class="line">By begging and thieving, so good was his lot;</p>
<p class="line">A thousand pound he would make it, he said,</p>
<p class="line">And then he would give over his trade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">But as he striv&rsquo;d his mind to fulfil,</p>
<p class="line">In following his actions so lewd and so ill,</p>
<p class="line">At last he was taken the law to suffice,</p>
<p class="line">Condemned and hanged at Exeter &lsquo;size.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Which made all men amazed to see</p>
<p class="line">That such an impudent cripple as he</p>
<p class="line">Should venture himself such actions as they,</p>
<p class="line">To rob in such sort upon the high-way.</p>

another man, and not seeing her &ldquo;the two old foxes&rdquo; began
to dig a grave, in which from her hiding-place she heard that after
murdering they intended putting her. The &ldquo;chin-champ&rdquo; was
the horse on which they rode away, when they failed to discover her.
&ldquo;Working hisself idle,&rdquo; is working in vain.</p>

<i>page</i> 20.&mdash;At the close of this ceremony eleven dozen buns
are thrown amongst the crowd to be scrambled for. One is always
reserved for the Mayor.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Wells</span>, <i>page</i> 65.&mdash;Some wells in
Cornwall (not holy) were famed for their wonderful virtues: I will
mention two. The water of the first, which was west of Penzance, was
esteemed a sovereign cure for sore eyes. People from far and near
visited it, and even carried away the water in bottles. It was,
however, best if possible to walk to the well before breakfast, and
there bathe the eyes. The second was at Castle Ch&ucirc;n, between
Penzance and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just; its water endowed the
drinkers with perpetual youth. Both have dried up within the last fifty
years.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ghosts</span>, <i>page</i> 99.&mdash;The following
quaint story was told me by a girl whose grandmother was the friend
mentioned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In the last century there lived in Trezelah (a hamlet
in the parish of Gulval, near Penzance), a widow who had been deprived
of her rights. Walking one day in the fields near her home she saw a
strange spotted dog who <span class="corr" id="xd25e6599" title=
"Source: semed">seemed</span> to know her; she met it a second time,
and decided when she next went out to take a friend with her. Again she
saw it (her friend did not), and said &ldquo;In the Name of the Lord,
speak to me.&rdquo; It changed into her husband, who told her to be
ready at a certain time, when he would fetch her. Soon after, her
friend being in the house, the woman, who was giving her children their
supper, said &ldquo;The time is come, I must be gone;&rdquo; she then
put on her sun-bonnet and went out. She was away about an hour, when
she suddenly appeared with a great noise, as if someone had hurled her
in through the door. Her story was that her husband had taken her up in
his arms and carried her over the tree-tops as far as Ludgvan Church,
where he deposited her on the Church-stile, from whence she saw a great
many spirits, some good and some bad. The latter wanted her to join
them, but her husband bade her remain where she was. What they told her
was never known; but by their aid she got back her rights. Then her
husband bore her home again by the way they had come; but before he
parted from her said &ldquo;I must take something from you; either your
eyesight, or your hearing.&rdquo; She preferred losing the latter, and
from that hour could never hear a word. One of her shoes that in her
flight through the air had caught on a tree-top, seven years after was
placed on her window-sill.</p>

141.&mdash;&ldquo;If you can throw fire over a witch you will break the
spell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bleeding a white hen on a millstone prevents
danger from the mill; for they say a mill will have blood every seven
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Charms</span>, <i>page</i> 144.&mdash;&ldquo;Some
were provided with little bags of earth, teeth, or bones taken from a
grave.&rdquo; &ldquo;Most of the very religious folks had a verse of
scripture, concluded with the comfortable assurance that by the help of
the Lord the white witch hopes to do them
good.&rdquo;&mdash;Bottrell.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Epilepsy</span>, <i>page</i> 154.&mdash;Another
authority says that the thirty pence collected by thirty young men at
the Church door is deposited for a half-crown, from which the centre is
cut. The flat ring left is worn by the epileptic person day and
night.<a id="xd25e6625" name="xd25e6625"></a>&mdash;Through

ends resting on low stools, or bottles. On this a person sits
lengthways with crossed <span class="corr" id="xd25e6647" title=

stick with a slit at one end, into which the paper effigy of the witch
is stuck. This must be burnt at a candle placed on the floor at a short

leave his perch.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
